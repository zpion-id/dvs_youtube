0:00:00,160 --> 0:00:01,920
a few years ago i made the world's first

2
0:00:01,920 --> 0:00:04,560
homemade silicon chip in my garage fab i

3
0:00:04,560 --> 0:00:06,399
just made version 2 which has 100

4
0:00:06,399 --> 0:00:08,400
transistors on it and they're smaller

5
0:00:08,400 --> 0:00:10,639
better and faster than the old one

6
0:00:10,639 --> 0:00:12,480
i made an array of 12 of these so that's

7
0:00:12,480 --> 0:00:15,040
1 200 transistors on the same piece of

8
0:00:15,040 --> 0:00:17,440
silicon intel's first processor had only

9
0:00:17,440 --> 0:00:19,279
2 000 transistors so we're already

10
0:00:19,279 --> 0:00:21,119
approaching a decent level of complexity

11
0:00:21,119 --> 0:00:22,480
and i should be able to make some really

12
0:00:22,480 --> 0:00:24,240
interesting circuits out of this soon i

13
0:00:24,240 --> 0:00:25,840
did some cool projects with my first

14
0:00:25,840 --> 0:00:28,240
chip like a led flasher and a guitar

15
0:00:28,240 --> 0:00:30,240
distortion pedal they worked really well

16
0:00:30,240 --> 0:00:31,760
but needed one or two nine volt

17
0:00:31,760 --> 0:00:33,280
batteries attached to them because the

18
0:00:33,280 --> 0:00:35,040
threshold voltage of the old mosfets

19
0:00:35,040 --> 0:00:36,239
were really high

20
0:00:36,239 --> 0:00:38,399
this new chip is made on a polysilicon

21
0:00:38,399 --> 0:00:40,800
gate process all these details are on

22
0:00:40,800 --> 0:00:42,800
the write up on my blog but the effect

23
0:00:42,800 --> 0:00:44,640
of that is that they work well at very

24
0:00:44,640 --> 0:00:45,920
low voltages they have a threshold

25
0:00:45,920 --> 0:00:48,239
voltage of only about 1 volt and that

26
0:00:48,239 --> 0:00:51,360
means that i can power them off of 3.3

27
0:00:51,360 --> 0:00:53,520
and 5 volt logic levels they draw less

28
0:00:53,520 --> 0:00:55,199
power and i should be able to pack more

29
0:00:55,199 --> 0:00:58,160
of them into a smaller die area for

30
0:00:58,160 --> 0:00:59,680
simple chips like this the process

31
0:00:59,680 --> 0:01:01,760
actually starts in photoshop there's

32
0:01:01,760 --> 0:01:03,600
only four layers to design and it's

33
0:01:03,600 --> 0:01:05,439
easier to use this than to use some more

34
0:01:05,439 --> 0:01:07,119
complicated software

35
0:01:07,119 --> 0:01:08,960
i start with a lot of 200 millimeter

36
0:01:08,960 --> 0:01:10,400
wafers that have some pretty specific

37
0:01:10,400 --> 0:01:12,240
starting parameters they're way too big

38
0:01:12,240 --> 0:01:14,159
so i dice them up using a diamond scribe

39
0:01:14,159 --> 0:01:16,400
into smaller bits i normally do about

40
0:01:16,400 --> 0:01:17,920
half inch squares like this but i can

41
0:01:17,920 --> 0:01:19,759
process larger things up to about two

42
0:01:19,759 --> 0:01:21,439
inch wafers

43
0:01:21,439 --> 0:01:23,280
the first layer to define is the doped

44
0:01:23,280 --> 0:01:25,119
layer that makes the source and drains

45
0:01:25,119 --> 0:01:27,119
the mosfets i put it on this homemade

46
0:01:27,119 --> 0:01:29,280
spin coater and then i deposit

47
0:01:29,280 --> 0:01:31,280
photoresist on top of it you only need

48
0:01:31,280 --> 0:01:33,439
about 100 microliters or so to cover a

49
0:01:33,439 --> 0:01:35,840
small wafer like this and we spin it at

50
0:01:35,840 --> 0:01:39,119
4000 rpm for 30 seconds

51
0:01:39,119 --> 0:01:40,720
after all the excess photoresist has

52
0:01:40,720 --> 0:01:42,720
been spun off it's dried on a hot plate

53
0:01:42,720 --> 0:01:44,960
at about 95 degrees c for one minute

54
0:01:44,960 --> 0:01:46,799
this drives off the rest of the solvents

55
0:01:46,799 --> 0:01:49,439
and leaves us with a solid film

56
0:01:49,439 --> 0:01:51,200
the result is a beautiful looking and

57
0:01:51,200 --> 0:01:55,759
uniform covering of the whole wafer

58
0:01:55,759 --> 0:01:57,840
then it's off to the homebuilt maskless

59
0:01:57,840 --> 0:01:59,920
photolithography stepper for exposure

60
0:01:59,920 --> 0:02:01,920
the basic idea is that we load up an

61
0:02:01,920 --> 0:02:03,360
image on this laptop that we want to

62
0:02:03,360 --> 0:02:05,200
project onto the chip then there's a

63
0:02:05,200 --> 0:02:07,200
standard dlp projector and some optics

64
0:02:07,200 --> 0:02:09,039
that shoot that down and reduce it onto

65
0:02:09,039 --> 0:02:10,800
the wafer i have a whole video on this

66
0:02:10,800 --> 0:02:13,280
tool so i recommend checking that out in

67
0:02:13,280 --> 0:02:14,879
the center you see a little blue dot

68
0:02:14,879 --> 0:02:16,959
that's the entire exposure field it

69
0:02:16,959 --> 0:02:19,200
lasts about nine seconds then the blue

70
0:02:19,200 --> 0:02:20,959
goes away at the end of the exposure we

71
0:02:20,959 --> 0:02:22,800
can step the wafer to another location

72
0:02:22,800 --> 0:02:25,440
and expose that part too

73
0:02:25,440 --> 0:02:27,040
just like processing filament a dark

74
0:02:27,040 --> 0:02:29,200
room the next step is development i put

75
0:02:29,200 --> 0:02:30,720
it in a couple percent potassium

76
0:02:30,720 --> 0:02:32,560
hydroxide solution for about a minute

77
0:02:32,560 --> 0:02:34,080
and this etches away the parts of the

78
0:02:34,080 --> 0:02:35,840
photoresist that were exposed because

79
0:02:35,840 --> 0:02:40,959
it's a positive photoresist

80
0:02:40,959 --> 0:02:42,319
i wash it with water to get rid of the

81
0:02:42,319 --> 0:02:44,160
residual developer and then we're ready

82
0:02:44,160 --> 0:02
to do the next step i can put under a

83
0:02 --> 0:02:47,599
microscope to inspect it and make sure

84
0:02:47,599 --> 0:02:49,440
everything worked out well if it didn't

85
0:02:49,440 --> 0:02:50,800
you can always just strip off the

86
0:02:50,800 --> 0:02:52,640
photoresist layer and try again with

87
0:02:52,640 --> 0:02:53,920
maybe a different exposure or

88
0:02:53,920 --> 0:02:56,080
development time

89
0:02:56,080 --> 0:02:57,280
now the image is formed in the

90
0:02:57,280 --> 0:02:59,280
photoresist i transfer that into the

91
0:02:59,280 --> 0:03:01,680
underlying polysilicon layer using an

92
0:03:01,680 --> 0:03:03,519
etchant once it's etched we don't need

93
0:03:03,519 --> 0:03:05,280
the photoresist mask layer anymore so

94
0:03:05,280 --> 0:03:12,400
that can be stripped off using acetone

95
0:03:12,400 --> 0:03:14,720
the wafer is then cleaned and dried and

96
0:03:14,720 --> 0:03:16,959
we spin on a dopant this is a

97
0:03:16,959 --> 0:03:19,200
phosphorous solution that's suspended in

98
0:03:19,200 --> 0:03:22,080
a liquid silicon dioxide this is spun on

99
0:03:22,080 --> 0:03:23,519
just like the photoresist and then we

100
0:03:23,519 --> 0:03:25,599
bake it at very high temperature over

101
0:03:25,599 --> 0:03:28,959
1000 degrees c for about 45 minutes this

102
0:03:28,959 --> 0:03:31,040
drives in the phosphorus atoms into the

103
0:03:31,040 --> 0:03:32,640
little wells that we just defined using

104
0:03:32,640 --> 0:03:35,440
lithography and that basically forms the

105
0:03:35,440 --> 0:03:37,920
source and drains of the mosfets i have

106
0:03:37,920 --> 0:03:38,959
to push it into the center of the

107
0:03:38,959 --> 0:03:41,280
furnace using this quartz rod and then

108
0:03:41,280 --> 0:03:42,640
at the end of the process we pulled out

109
0:03:42,640 --> 0:03:44,480
the other side the process of spin

110
0:03:44,480 --> 0:03:46,640
coating photoresist baking it exposing

111
0:03:46,640 --> 0:03:48,400
it and developing it is then repeated

112
0:03:48,400 --> 0:03:50,640
exactly twice once for the gate layer

113
0:03:50,640 --> 0:03:52,959
and then again for the contact the gate

114
0:03:52,959 --> 0:03:54,959
is etched just like we did before with

115
0:03:54,959 --> 0:03:57,200
the polysilicon etchant and the contact

116
0:03:57,200 --> 0:03:59,599
layer has to be etched as well because

117
0:03:59,599 --> 0:04:01,200
now after the high temperature step

118
0:04:01,200 --> 0:04:02,959
there's a layer of silicon dioxide

119
0:04:02,959 --> 0:04:04,799
insulating everything so after the

120
0:04:04,799 --> 0:04:06,959
contact mask is formed you have to use

121
0:04:06,959 --> 0:04:09,360
something like hydrofluoric acid or

122
0:04:09,360 --> 0:04:10,720
chf3

123
0:04:10,720 --> 0:04:12,879
reactive ion etching to get rid of that

124
0:04:12,879 --> 0:04:14,319
insulator so we can make good electrical

125
0:04:14,319 --> 0:04:15,439
contact

126
0:04:15,439 --> 0:04:17,040
then we stick the wafer into a vacuum

127
0:04:17,040 --> 0:04:19,040
chamber to either sputter or thermally

128
0:04:19,040 --> 0:04:21,600
evaporate metal i'm evaporating aluminum

129
0:04:21,600 --> 0:04:24,240
a thick layer of about a micron or so

130
0:04:24,240 --> 0:04:25,440
and then we do the whole

131
0:04:25,440 --> 0:04:27,840
photolithography process again of spin

132
0:04:27,840 --> 0:04:30,240
coating and exposing and developing to

133
0:04:30,240 --> 0:04:32,240
define that metal layer

134
0:04:32,240 --> 0:04:34,560
once that's done stick the wafer into a

135
0:04:34,560 --> 0:04:36,800
warm phosphoric acid bath that etches

136
0:04:36,800 --> 0:04:39,120
off the residual aluminum and finally

137
0:04:39,120 --> 0:04:40,560
the chip is done

138
0:04:40,560 --> 0:04
at this point i'll inspect the chip

139
0:04 --> 0:04:43,520
pretty thoroughly and take a lot of

140
0:04:43,520 --> 0:04:45,120
close-up pictures to measure parameters

141
0:04:45,120 --> 0:04:47,199
like gate length and width and layer

142
0:04:47,199 --> 0:04:49,280
thicknesses if i do a cross-section i

143
0:04:49,280 --> 0:04:50,800
can put it on the probe station which

144
0:04:50,800 --> 0:04:52,720
has a bunch of really small tungsten

145
0:04:52,720 --> 0:04:54,800
needles and allow me to make connections

146
0:04:54,800 --> 0:04:56,800
directly to the transistors it's very

147
0:04:56,800 --> 0:04:58,880
finicky and these transistors are so

148
0:04:58,880 --> 0:05:01,280
small that it's not actually that

149
0:05:01,280 --> 0:05:03,680
trivial to make contact to them but

150
0:05:03,680 --> 0:05:06,080
anyway i boot up all this test equipment

151
0:05:06,080 --> 0:05:08,720
that allows me to characterize them i do

152
0:05:08,720 --> 0:05:10,479
a little bit of programming to define

153
0:05:10,479 --> 0:05:12,880
the kind of tests i want to do and then

154
0:05:12,880 --> 0:05:15,120
hopefully we're greeted with this great

155
0:05:15,120 --> 0:05:17,440
curve so this is the

156
0:05:17,440 --> 0:05:20,160
id versus vds curve of an n channel

157
0:05:20,160 --> 0:05:22,720
mosfet here's an ideal one

158
0:05:22,720 --> 0:05:24,639
taken off of the internet and then

159
0:05:24,639 --> 0:05
here's the one that i'm getting from my

160
0:05 --> 0:05:28,639
fets and they look great

161
0:05:28,639 --> 0:05:29,840
i hope you found that interesting and

162
0:05:29,840 --> 0:05:31,120
enjoyed learning about my second

163
0:05:31,120 --> 0:05:32,800
integrated circuit i got a bunch of

164
0:05:32,800 --> 0:05:34,400
requests to set up a patreon or

165
0:05:34,400 --> 0:05:35,919
something like that i'm not sure if

166
0:05:35,919 --> 0:05:37,520
that's the best way to do it but i'll

167
0:05:37,520 --> 0:05:39,280
put a link in the description if you

168
0:05:39,280 --> 0:05:40,960
want to support more homebrew

169
0:05:40,960 --> 0:05:42,800
semiconductor fabrication experiments

170
0:05:42,800 --> 0:05:43,840
like this

171
0:05:43,840 --> 0:05:47,160
thanks for watching
