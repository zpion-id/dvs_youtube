0:00:01,120 --> 0:00:02,960
in this video we're going to focus on

2
0:00:02,960 --> 0:00:04,560
linear regression

3
0:00:04,560 --> 0:00:07,680
using the least squares method

4
0:00:07,680 --> 0:00:09,679
and this approach will help us to write

5
0:00:09,679 --> 0:00:11,120
a linear equation

6
0:00:11,120 --> 0:00:14,160
that best fits the data in the table

7
0:00:14,160 --> 0:00:16,080
shown below

8
0:00:16,080 --> 0:00:18,720
so let me give you a visual illustration

9
0:00:18,720 --> 0:00:20,880
so let's say

10
0:00:20,880 --> 0:00:23,119
we have these data points which i'm

11
0:00:23,119 --> 0:00:26,800
going to highlight in blue

12
0:00:26,800 --> 0:00:31,119
now these data points don't all

13
0:00:31,119 --> 0:00:33,680
fall on a straight line however what we

14
0:00:33,680 --> 0:00:34,559
can do

15
0:00:34,559 --> 0:00:37,120
is we can calculate the equation of a

16
0:00:37,120 --> 0:00:38,079
line that best

17
0:00:38,079 --> 0:00:41,040
fits this data where all of the points

18
0:00:41,040 --> 0:00:41,440
are

19
0:00:41,440 --> 0:00:46,320
as close to as possible to that line

20
0:00:46,320 --> 0:00:47,520
now what we're going to do is we're

21
0:00:47,520 --> 0:00:49,200
going to use a method called the least

22
0:00:49,200 --> 0:00:50,320
squares method

23
0:00:50,320 --> 0:00:52,640
to find the equation of the line and

24
0:00:52,640 --> 0:00:54,079
then once we have it

25
0:00:54,079 --> 0:00:56,559
we're going to test that equation to see

26
0:00:56,559 --> 0:00:58,320
how accurate it is

27
0:00:58,320 --> 0:01:00,719
in giving us the y values when we input

28
0:01:00,719 --> 0:01:02,079
the x values

29
0:01:02,079 --> 0:01:03,280
and then we're going to confirm our

30
0:01:03,280 --> 0:01:05,199
answer using excel

31
0:01:05,199 --> 0:01:10,479
so let's begin

32
0:01:10,479 --> 0:01:11,840
so the first thing we're going to do is

33
0:01:11,840 --> 0:01:15,119
we're going to create a table

34
0:01:15,119 --> 0:01:19,280
this table is going to have four columns

35
0:01:19,280 --> 0:01:22,479
so the first column

36
0:01:22,479 --> 0:01:25,520
is going to be x the second column is

37
0:01:25,520 --> 0:01:27,200
going to be y

38
0:01:27,200 --> 0:01:30,159
the third column will be the product of

39
0:01:30,159 --> 0:01:32,079
x and y

40
0:01:32,079 --> 0:01:38,840
and then the last column will be x

41
0:01:38,840 --> 0:01:40,079
squared

42
0:01:40,079 --> 0:01:42,399
now let's plug in the values so the

43
0:01:42,399 --> 0:01:44,960
first x value is one

44
0:01:44,960 --> 0:01:48,320
next is two and then

45
0:01:48,320 --> 0:01:51,680
three

46
0:01:51,680 --> 0:01:56,880
four of that is 5

47
0:01:56,880 --> 0:02:01,119
6 and 7.

48
0:02:01,119 --> 0:02:02,560
now let's write the corresponding y

49
0:02:02,560 --> 0:02:05,840
values so it's going to be 1.5

50
0:02:05,840 --> 0:02:09,520
3.8 based on what we see in this table

51
0:02:09,520 --> 0:02:13,920
and then it's uh 6.7

52
0:02:13,920 --> 0:02:18,760
9.0 11.2

53
0:02:18,760 --> 0:02:21,680
13.6 and then 16.

54
0:02:21,680 --> 0:02:24,160
now for the next column we need to

55
0:02:24,160 --> 0:02:25,200
multiply

56
0:02:25,200 --> 0:02:28,640
x and y together

57
0:02:28,640 --> 0:02:32,959
so 1 times 1.5 is 1.5

58
0:02:32,959 --> 0:02:36,160
2 times 3.8 that's going to be

59
0:02:36,160 --> 0:02:40,080
seven point six three times six point

60
0:02:40,080 --> 0:02:42,239
seven

61
0:02:42,239 --> 0:02:45,040
that's twenty point one four times nine

62
0:02:45,040 --> 0:02:47,519
is thirty six

63
0:02:47,519 --> 0:02:51,360
five times eleven point two

64
0:02:51,360 --> 0:02:55,120
56 and then 6 times 13.6

65
0:02:55,120 --> 0:02:59,599
that's 81.6 now 7 times 16

66
0:02:59,599 --> 0:03:03,760
7 times 10 is 70 7 times 6 is 42

67
0:03:03,760 --> 0:03:07,760
70 plus 42 is 112. now let's calculate

68
0:03:07,760 --> 0:03:11,120
x squared one squared is one two squared

69
0:03:11,120 --> 0:03:12,239
is four

70
0:03:12,239 --> 0:03:14,640
three squared is nine four squared is

71
0:03:14,640 --> 0:03:16,159
sixteen

72
0:03:16,159 --> 0:03:20,080
five squared is 25 6 squared is 36

73
0:03:20,080 --> 0:03:23,680
7 squared is 49. now the next thing we

74
0:03:23,680 --> 0:03:24,640
need to do

75
0:03:24,640 --> 0:03:27,599
is we need to take the sum of each

76
0:03:27,599 --> 0:03:28,480
column

77
0:03:28,480 --> 0:03:32,400
of numbers so let's go ahead and do that

78
0:03:32,400 --> 0:03
so let's start with the sum

79
0:03 --> 0:03:39,680
of the x values so let's add up

80
0:03:39,680 --> 0:03:43,840
every number in the first column

81
0:03:43,840 --> 0:03:46,959
1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6

82
0:03:46,959 --> 0:03:51,840
plus 7 and that's going to be

83
0:03:51,840 --> 0:03:54,400
28. now let's take the sum of the y

84
0:03:54,400 --> 0:03:55,760
values

85
0:03:55,760 --> 0:04:00,080
so 1.5 plus 3.8 plus 6.7 plus

86
0:04:00,080 --> 0:04:04,480
9 plus 11.2 plus 13.6

87
0:04:04,480 --> 0:04:07,959
plus 16. so that's

88
0:04:07,959 --> 0:04:10,879
61.8 now

89
0:04:10,879 --> 0:04:12,720
let's find the sum of the next column

90
0:04:12,720 --> 0:04:14,959
the sum of the xy values

91
0:04:14,959 --> 0:04:18,560
so 1.5 plus 7.6

92
0:04:18,560 --> 0:04:21,600
and so forth all the way to

93
0:04:21,600 --> 0:04:25,280
112. if we add those seven numbers

94
0:04:25,280 --> 0:04:28,800
we're going to get 314.8

95
0:04:28,800 --> 0:04:32,160
now let's find the sum of

96
0:04:32,160 --> 0:04:35,840
the x squared values so 1 plus 4 plus 9

97
0:04:35,840 --> 0:04:36,639
plus 16

98
0:04:36,639 --> 0:04:40,960
plus 25 plus 36 plus 49

99
0:04:40,960 --> 0:04
that's going to be 140. now let's write

100
0:04 --> 0:04:46,560
down the important information

101
0:04:46,560 --> 0:04:49,440
that we've gleaned from this table the

102
0:04:49,440 --> 0:04:51,040
sum of the x values

103
0:04:51,040 --> 0:04
is this number here so that's 28.

104
0:04 --> 0:05:02,240
now the sum of the y values

105
0:05:02,240 --> 0:05:07,280
is 61.8

106
0:05:07,280 --> 0:05:08,880
these values are important because it's

107
0:05:08,880 --> 0:05:10,800
going to help us to calculate the slope

108
0:05:10,800 --> 0:05:12,320
and the y-intercept of the linear

109
0:05:12,320 --> 0:05:14,080
equation

110
0:05:14,080 --> 0:05:18,800
next we have the sum

111
0:05:18,800 --> 0:05:22,160
of the x-y values

112
0:05:22,160 --> 0:05:27,199
and that's 314 314.8

113
0:05:27,199 --> 0:05:31,360
and finally we have the sum

114
0:05:31,360 --> 0:05:36,560
of the x squared values which is 140.

115
0:05:36,560 --> 0:05:38,960
so now that we wrote that let's get rid

116
0:05:38,960 --> 0:05:42,960
of this

117
0:05:42,960 --> 0:05:44,400
so the linear equation will be in this

118
0:05:44,400 --> 0:05:46,400
format y is equal to mx

119
0:05:46,400 --> 0:05:50,479
plus b in statistics

120
0:05:50,479 --> 0:05:52,400
you might see an equation like this y is

121
0:05:52,400 --> 0:05:53,759
equal to b

122
0:05:53,759 --> 0:05:57,120
zero plus b one x

123
0:05:57,120 --> 0:05:59,039
so what you need to know is that the

124
0:05:59,039 --> 0:06:00,479
slope the number in front of

125
0:06:00,479 --> 0:06:03,759
x is m or b one do the same

126
0:06:03,759 --> 0:06:05,520
so i'm just gonna write that here so the

127
0:06:05,520 --> 0:06:06,800
slope

128
0:06:06,800 --> 0:06:11,039
of the line is equal to m which is

129
0:06:11,039 --> 0:06:12,560
how you'll see it in algebra but in

130
0:06:12,560 --> 0:06:16,319
statistics you might see b1

131
0:06:16,319 --> 0:06:19,600
now the y-intercept

132
0:06:19,600 --> 0:06:21,600
and algebra is represented by the symbol

133
0:06:21,600 --> 0:06:26,080
b so i'm going to highlight that in blue

134
0:06:26,080 --> 0:06:29,039
in statistics you'll see it as b0 so

135
0:06:29,039 --> 0:06:30,479
these two numbers

136
0:06:30,479 --> 0:06:34,400
they're the same

137
0:06:34,400 --> 0:06:38,639
in this video i'm going to focus on

138
0:06:38,639 --> 0:06:40,400
the linear equation in slope intercept

139
0:06:40,400 --> 0:06:42,240
form as taught in algebra

140
0:06:42,240 --> 0:06:44,400
that is in this format y is equal to mx

141
0:06:44,400 --> 0:06:46,479
plus b

142
0:06:46,479 --> 0:06:48,080
but i want you to see the relationship

143
0:06:48,080 --> 0:06:50,160
between how a linear equation is

144
0:06:50,160 --> 0:06:51,680
described in algebra

145
0:06:51,680 --> 0:06
compared to how it's described in

146
0:06 --> 0:06:57,280
statistics

147
0:06:57,280 --> 0:06:59,199
now let's talk about how we can

148
0:06:59,199 --> 0:07:02,639
calculate the slope in this example

149
0:07:02,639 --> 0:07:06,080
so the slope is equal to n

150
0:07:06,080 --> 0:07:09,280
times the sum of the x y values

151
0:07:09,280 --> 0:07:13,120
minus the sum of the x values times

152
0:07:13,120 --> 0:07:15,919
the sum of the y values and then we're

153
0:07:15,919 --> 0:07:16,960
going to divide that by

154
0:07:16,960 --> 0:07:20,240
n times the sum of

155
0:07:20,240 --> 0:07:23,360
x squared minus the sum

156
0:07:23,360 --> 0:07:26,800
of x squared

157
0:07:26,800 --> 0:07:29,599
by the way n is the number of values

158
0:07:29,599 --> 0:07:31,120
that we have in our data

159
0:07:31,120 --> 0:07:35,520
so we have seven points thus n is seven

160
0:07:35,520 --> 0:07:37,280
so let's plug everything into the slope

161
0:07:37,280 --> 0:07:40,240
formula so this is going to be seven

162
0:07:40,240 --> 0:07:44,280
times the sum of x y which

163
0:07:44,280 --> 0:07:48,319
314.8 minus the sum of x

164
0:07:48,319 --> 0:07:51,400
so that's 28 times the sum of y which is

165
0:07:51,400 --> 0:07
61.8

166
0:07 --> 0:07:56,960
and then divided by n now the sum of x

167
0:07:56,960 --> 0:08:01,199
squared that's 140

168
0:08:01,199 --> 0:08:05,120
and then minus the sum of x which is 28

169
0:08:05,120 --> 0:08:08,479
but we're going to square that and so

170
0:08:08,479 --> 0:08:12,319
this is what we're going to get

171
0:08:12,319 --> 0:08:15,360
so now let's plug everything in 7 times

172
0:08:15,360 --> 0:08:17,280
3 14.8

173
0:08:17,280 --> 0:08:20,879
minus 28 times 61.8

174
0:08:20,879 --> 0:08
that's 473.2

175
0:08 --> 0:08:30,720
then 7 times 140 minus 28 squared

176
0:08:30,720 --> 0:08:34,159
that's 196.

177
0:08:34,159 --> 0:08:37,919
so dividing these two numbers

178
0:08:37,919 --> 0:08:44,640
this is going to be 2.4142857

179
0:08:44,640 --> 0:08:45,920
so i'm just going to rewrite that at the

180
0:08:45,920 --> 0:08:48,160
bottom so we can

181
0:08:48,160 --> 0:08:52,560
save that for later so this is the slope

182
0:08:52,560 --> 0:08:57,440
of the line

183
0:08:57,440 --> 0:08:59,760
i'm not going to round it early because

184
0:08:59,760 --> 0:09:01,200
we're going to need our m value to

185
0:09:01,200 --> 0:09
calculate our b

186
0:09 --> 0:09:12,399
value so now we can get rid of this

187
0:09:12,399 --> 0:09:15,440
now let's calculate the y intercept b

188
0:09:15,440 --> 0:09:17,600
so this is going to be the sum of the y

189
0:09:17,600 --> 0:09:18,720
values

190
0:09:18,720 --> 0:09:22,800
minus m times the sum of the x values

191
0:09:22,800 --> 0:09:26,560
divided by n so the sum of the y values

192
0:09:26,560 --> 0:09:28,399
that's 61.8

193
0:09:28,399 --> 0:09:31,600
our m value we're going to use the most

194
0:09:31,600 --> 0:09:33,120
accurate number that we have

195
0:09:33,120 --> 0:09:35,760
to get an accurate b value so this is

196
0:09:35,760 --> 0:09
two point four one four

197
0:09 --> 0:09:41,839
two eight five seven

198
0:09:41,839 --> 0:09:44,399
if we round it too early it will affect

199
0:09:44,399 --> 0:09:45,519
our b value

200
0:09:45,519 --> 0:09:46,800
so that's why the one around it too

201
0:09:46,800 --> 0:09:50,320
early the sum of the x values is 28

202
0:09:50,320 --> 0:09:53,680
divided by n which is seven

203
0:09:53,680 --> 0:10:00,959
so if you plug this in

204
0:10:00,959 --> 0:10:04,320
you should get negative five point

205
0:10:04,320 --> 0:10:06,079
approximately negative 5.8 on the

206
0:10:06,079 --> 0:10:10,560
numerator divided by seven

207
0:10:10,560 --> 0:10:13,600
this will give you

208
0:10:13,600 --> 0:10:16,720
a b value of negative

209
0:10:16,720 --> 0:10:25,920
point 0.828571

210
0:10:25,920 --> 0:10:28,959
all right so now let's get rid of this

211
0:10:28,959 --> 0:10:35,120
and we no longer need this information

212
0:10:35,120 --> 0:10:37,279
so to write the linear equation we need

213
0:10:37,279 --> 0:10:39,040
to plug in our m value

214
0:10:39,040 --> 0:10:41,680
and our b value into the slope intercept

215
0:10:41,680 --> 0:10:42,640
equation

216
0:10:42,640 --> 0:10:44,880
so it's going to be y is equal to i'm

217
0:10:44,880 --> 0:10:46,399
going to round the slope

218
0:10:46,399 --> 0:10:50,880
to 2.41 and then i'm going to round b

219
0:10:50,880 --> 0:10:53,920
to negative 0.83

220
0:10:53,920 --> 0:10:57,200
we don't need to use the exact answer

221
0:10:57,200 --> 0:10:58,320
so this will be a good enough

222
0:10:58,320 --> 0:11:01,440
approximation of the data

223
0:11:01,440 --> 0:11:03,519
that we have in a table and let's check

224
0:11:03,519 --> 0:11:04,880
it so let's

225
0:11:04,880 --> 0:11:07,920
see what our y value will be if we plug

226
0:11:07,920 --> 0:11:08,880
in

227
0:11:08,880 --> 0:11:12,839
an x value of 2. so this is going to be

228
0:11:12,839 --> 0:11:14,480
2.41

229
0:11:14,480 --> 0:11:21,440
times 2 minus 0.83

230
0:11:21,440 --> 0:11:24,720
and so we get 3.99

231
0:11:24,720 --> 0:11:28,800
now 3.99 is not too far away from 3.8

232
0:11:28,800 --> 0:11
so that's a good approximation

233
0:11 --> 0:11:33,440
now let's try plugging in a different

234
0:11:33,440 --> 0:11:37,920
value let's go with 5.

235
0:11:37,920 --> 0:11:42,800
so 2.41 times 5 minus

236
0:11:42,800 --> 0:11:48,640
0.83

237
0:11:48,640 --> 0:11:52,920
so this is equal to 11.22

238
0:11:52,920 --> 0:11:57,279
11.22 is very close to 11.2 so that's an

239
0:11:57,279 --> 0:12:00,800
even better approximation now let's try

240
0:12:00,800 --> 0:12:02,959
one more

241
0:12:02,959 --> 0:12:13,200
let's try an x value of seven

242
0:12:13,200 --> 0:12:17,320
in this case i get 16.04

243
0:12:17,320 --> 0:12:20,720
16.04 is very close to 16.

244
0:12:20,720 --> 0:12:23,200
so thus we could see that this linear

245
0:12:23,200 --> 0:12:24,560
equation

246
0:12:24,560 --> 0:12:28,560
fits the observed data very well

247
0:12:28,560 --> 0:12:30,320
so now you know how to use the least

248
0:12:30,320 --> 0:12:31,839
squares method

249
0:12:31,839 --> 0:12:33,839
when performing linear regression that

250
0:12:33,839 --> 0:12:35,040
is when you need to write a linear

251
0:12:35,040 --> 0:12
equation

252
0:12 --> 0:12:39,040
that best fits the observed data of some

253
0:12:39,040 --> 0:12:41,600
type of experiment or something

254
0:12:41,600 --> 0:12:44,079
now what we're going to do at this point

255
0:12:44,079 --> 0:12:45,680
is that we're going to use

256
0:12:45,680 --> 0:12:49,040
excel to quickly get

257
0:12:49,040 --> 0:12:51,120
the slope and the y-intercept because

258
0:12:51,120 --> 0:12:52,880
once we have m and b

259
0:12:52,880 --> 0:12:54,959
all we need to do is plug it into this

260
0:12:54,959 --> 0:12
equation

261
0:12 --> 0:12:58,480
and we have our linear equation that

262
0:12:58,480 --> 0:13:00,160
best fits the data

263
0:13:00,160 --> 0:13
and sometimes when you're performing a

264
0:13 --> 0:13:03,680
science experiment or if you have a lab

265
0:13:03,680 --> 0:13:04,560
report

266
0:13:04,560 --> 0:13:06,079
and you need to write a linear equation

267
0:13:06,079 --> 0:13:08,079
that best describes the data

268
0:13:08,079 --> 0:13:10,320
excel is a quick and simple way to do it

269
0:13:10,320 --> 0:13:12,480
it'll save you a lot of time

270
0:13:12,480 --> 0:13:14,800
so here we have excel and what we're

271
0:13:14,800 --> 0:13:16,160
going to do is

272
0:13:16,160 --> 0:13:18,399
we're going to plug in our x and our y

273
0:13:18,399 --> 0:13:19,760
values

274
0:13:19,760 --> 0:13:23,040
into columns b and c so let's start with

275
0:13:23,040 --> 0:13:25,839
the x values

276
0:13:25,839 --> 0:13:29,040
so it's 1 is 7 and then let's

277
0:13:29,040 --> 0:13:32,399
input the corresponding y values so it's

278
0:13:32,399 --> 0:13:33,279
1.5

279
0:13:33,279 --> 0:13:37,920
3.8 6.7

280
0:13:37,920 --> 0:13:42,720
9 11.2 13.6

281
0:13:42,720 --> 0:13:45,760
and 16. now the next thing we need to

282
0:13:45,760 --> 0:13
calculate is the slope

283
0:13 --> 0:13:51,760
so in cell c9 type in equal

284
0:13:51,760 --> 0:13:55,199
slope open parenthesis now notice that

285
0:13:55,199 --> 0:13:55,920
it says

286
0:13:55,920 --> 0:13:59,680
the known y values you want to highlight

287
0:13:59,680 --> 0:14:02,079
the values in the y column once you do

288
0:14:02,079 --> 0:14:02,800
that press

289
0:14:02,800 --> 0:14:05,279
comma and then it says the known x

290
0:14:05,279 --> 0:14:06,320
values

291
0:14:06,320 --> 0:14:09,360
highlight the values in the x column

292
0:14:09,360 --> 0:14
close parenthesis and then hit enter and

293
0:14 --> 0:14:14,839
notice that we get the same slope

294
0:14:14,839 --> 0:14:17,760
2.414

295
0:14:17,760 --> 0:14:20,320
which is what we got earlier in this

296
0:14:20,320 --> 0:14:21,440
video

297
0:14:21,440 --> 0:14:22,720
so now we're going to calculate the

298
0:14:22,720 --> 0:14:25,600
y-intercept using excel

299
0:14:25,600 --> 0:14:28,880
so if you type in equal intercept

300
0:14:28,880 --> 0:14:32,240
open parenthesis highlight the y values

301
0:14:32,240 --> 0:14:35,199
press comma and then highlight the x

302
0:14:35,199 --> 0:14:35,760
values

303
0:14:35,760 --> 0:14:38,639
close parenthesis press enter now it

304
0:14:38,639 --> 0:14:39,920
gives you the b value

305
0:14:39,920 --> 0:14:44,959
the y-intercept which is negative 0.8285

306
0:14:44,959 --> 0:14:48,079
which is what we had earlier as well so

307
0:14:48,079 --> 0:14:50,160
as you can see this is a very

308
0:14:50,160 --> 0:14:52,800
time-saving method to calculate the

309
0:14:52,800 --> 0:14:54,560
slope and the y-intercept of the linear

310
0:14:54,560 --> 0:14:55,360
equation

311
0:14:55,360 --> 0:14:58,160
that bets fits the data so that's it for

312
0:14:58,160 --> 0:14:59,519
this video hopefully you found it to be

313
0:14:59,519 --> 0:15:00,399
