0:00:06,560 --> 0:00:07,759
hello dan here from

2
0:00:07,759 --> 0:00:09,599
howtomechatronics.com

3
0:00:09,599 --> 0:00:11,759
and in this video i will show you how i

4
0:00:11,759 --> 0:00:14,400
built a cnc pen plotter or a drawing

5
0:00:14,400 --> 0:00:16,560
machine but with one cool feature and

6
0:00:16,560 --> 0:00:18,720
that's automatic tool change

7
0:00:18,720 --> 0:00:20,800
in other words the machine will be able

8
0:00:20,800 --> 0:00:23,439
to automatically change colors and so we

9
0:00:23,439 --> 0:00:26,160
can draw really cool stuff with it

10
0:00:26,160 --> 0:00:27,920
the construction of the machine is based

11
0:00:27,920 --> 0:00:30,560
on my diy cnc laser engraver machine

12
0:00:30,560 --> 0:00:32,880
from my previous video where the goal

13
0:00:32,880 --> 0:00:34,880
was to make the simplest cnc machine

14
0:00:34,880 --> 0:00:37,040
with minimum parts possible

15
0:00:37,040 --> 0:00:39,600
it uses three nema 17 stepper motors for

16
0:00:39,600 --> 0:00:42,719
the x y and z axis motion and a small

17
0:00:42,719 --> 0:00:45,280
servo motor for the gripper the brain of

18
0:00:45,280 --> 0:00:47,600
the cnc machine is an arduino uno board

19
0:00:47,600 --> 0:00
in combination with a cnc shield and

20
0:00 --> 0:00:53,120
three a4988 stepper drivers

21
0:00:53,120 --> 0:00:57,360
the work area is fairly big 360 by 280

22
0:00:57,360 --> 0:00:59,600
millimeters and the level of details

23
0:00:59,600 --> 0:01:02,399
this plotter can output is in my opinion

24
0:01:02,399 --> 0:01:04,159
quite impressive too

25
0:01:04,159 --> 0:01:06,400
i was actually surprised how good and

26
0:01:06,400 --> 0:01:08,880
precise the drawings came out especially

27
0:01:08,880 --> 0:01:11,920
the ones where i used 0.6 millimeters

28
0:01:11,920 --> 0:01:13,200
gel pen

29
0:01:13,200 --> 0:01:14,960
nevertheless now i will explain

30
0:01:14,960 --> 0:01:16,479
everything you need to know about

31
0:01:16,479 --> 0:01:18,479
building a drawing machine like this

32
0:01:18,479 --> 0:01:20,720
including how to design it connect the

33
0:01:20,720 --> 0:01:23,200
electronics what firmware and software

34
0:01:23,200 --> 0:01:26,560
to use and how to generate g-code for it

35
0:01:26,560 --> 0:01:28,400
to begin with let's have a look at the

36
0:01:28,400 --> 0:01:31,119
design of the cnc machine as i already

37
0:01:31,119 --> 0:01:33,280
mentioned this machine is based on the

38
0:01:33,280 --> 0:01:35,200
design of my previous cnc laser

39
0:01:35,200 --> 0:01:37,360
engraving machine where the goal was to

40
0:01:37,360 --> 0:01:39,680
make a very simple cnc with minimum

41
0:01:39,680 --> 0:01:41,119
parts possible

42
0:01:41,119 --> 0:01:43,439
the two main components here are these

43
0:01:43,439 --> 0:01:46,960
mgn 15h linear rails together with their

44
0:01:46,960 --> 0:01:48,799
suitable sliding blocks

45
0:01:48,799 --> 0:01:51,360
the motion for the x and the y axis is

46
0:01:51,360 --> 0:01:54,240
provided through gt2 belts and some gt2

47
0:01:54,240 --> 0:01:55,520
pulleys

48
0:01:55,520 --> 0:01:58,079
as for the z-axis we have a simple

49
0:01:58,079 --> 0:02:00,240
reciprocating motion where the moving

50
0:02:00,240 --> 0:02:03,040
parts slide up and down on two six

51
0:02:03,040 --> 0:02:05,439
millimeters linear rods and suitable

52
0:02:05,439 --> 0:02:06,960
linear bearings

53
0:02:06,960 --> 0:02:09,200
a small hobby servo is used for gripping

54
0:02:09,200 --> 0:02:10,560
the pen

55
0:02:10,560 --> 0:02:12,560
a homing position is essential for this

56
0:02:12,560 --> 0:02:15,040
pen plotter as the pen holders have a

57
0:02:15,040 --> 0:02:17,920
specific fixed position so the machine

58
0:02:17,920 --> 0:02:19,760
must have a starting point

59
0:02:19,760 --> 0:02:21,760
therefore we must have a limit switches

60
0:02:21,760 --> 0:02:23,520
for each axis

61
0:02:23,520 --> 0:02:25,920
you can find and download this 3d model

62
0:02:25,920 --> 0:02:28,080
as well as the stl files which are used

63
0:02:28,080 --> 0:02:30,800
for 3d printing on the website article

64
0:02:30,800 --> 0:02:33,599
the link is in the video description

65
0:02:33,599 --> 0:02:35,519
so here are all the parts needed for

66
0:02:35,519 --> 0:02:37,760
assembling this pen plotter but before

67
0:02:37,760 --> 0:02:39,440
we do that i would like to thank

68
0:02:39,440 --> 0:02:41,920
surfshark for sponsoring this video and

69
0:02:41,920 --> 0:02:44,160
also explain why and how i actually use

70
0:02:44,160 --> 0:02:45,280
this service

71
0:02:45,280 --> 0:02:47,840
within a second of visiting any website

72
0:02:47,840 --> 0:02:50,800
your location hardware details operating

73
0:02:50,800 --> 0:02:52,640
system as well as all of your past

74
0:02:52,640 --> 0:02:55,680
browsing history is immediately exposed

75
0:02:55,680 --> 0:02:58,239
surfshark virtual private network keeps

76
0:02:58,239 --> 0:03:00,879
your information safe by encrypting all

77
0:03:00,879 --> 0:03:02,959
internet traffic to and from your

78
0:03:02,959 --> 0:03:05,760
devices and ensures that your ip remains

79
0:03:05,760 --> 0:03:07,760
hidden to make sure that nobody see what

80
0:03:07,760 --> 0:03:09,120
you do online

81
0:03:09,120 --> 0:03:11,360
another great reason to use a vpn is

82
0:03:11,360 --> 0:03:13,519
because content from streaming services

83
0:03:13,519 --> 0:03
can be restricted based on what country

84
0:03 --> 0:03:17,040
you are in

85
0:03:17,040 --> 0:03:18,959
with surf shark you can solve that

86
0:03:18,959 --> 0:03
problem by simply changing your location

87
0:03 --> 0:03:24,080
not only is this good for people who

88
0:03:24,080 --> 0:03:25,840
want to keep up with their favorite

89
0:03:25,840 --> 0:03:28,319
shows but it can be also a critical tool

90
0:03:28,319 --> 0:03:30,640
for those who live in countries that

91
0:03:30,640 --> 0:03:33,760
heavily censor or monitor its citizens

92
0:03:33,760 --> 0:03:36,080

surfshark offers 30 day money back

98
0:03:47,920 --> 0:03:50,720
guarantee so there is no risk to try it

99
0:03:50,720 --> 0:03:52,720
out for yourself

100
0:03:52,720 --> 0:03:54,560
alright so now we can start assembling

101
0:03:54,560 --> 0:03:56,799
the machine i started by securing the

102
0:03:56,799 --> 0:03:58,720
base plate and the bracket for the

103
0:03:58,720 --> 0:04:01,040
linear rail together with the help of

104
0:04:01,040 --> 0:04:02,799
some m3 bolts

105
0:04:02,799 --> 0:04:04,560
all of the bolts for unassembling this

106
0:04:04,560 --> 0:04:07,120
machine are actually m3 with various

107
0:04:07,120 --> 0:04:09,920
lengths except for a few m5 bolts needed

108
0:04:09,920 --> 0:04:12,080
for the gt2 pulleys

109
0:04:12,080 --> 0:04:14,400
once we have the two sides ready we can

110
0:04:14,400 --> 0:04:17,359
secure the x-axis linear rail to them

111
0:04:17,359 --> 0:04
with two bolts on each side

112
0:04 --> 0:04:23,199
these amg and 15h rails provide very

113
0:04:23,199 --> 0:04:25,600
smooth and play-free motion as their

114
0:04:25,600 --> 0:04:27,840
sliding blocks have balls or rollers

115
0:04:27,840 --> 0:04:29,040
inside them

116
0:04:29,040 --> 0:04:31,199
however before installing them it's a

117
0:04:31,199 --> 0:04:33,440
good idea to clean and grease them well

118
0:04:33,440 --> 0:04:35,600
in order to work properly

119
0:04:35,600 --> 0:04:38,240
next the y-axis rail should go on top of

120
0:04:38,240 --> 0:04:40,800
the x-axis sliding block and for

121
0:04:40,800 --> 0:04:42,720
securing them together we will use the

122
0:04:42,720 --> 0:04:44,720
central mounting plate

123
0:04:44,720 --> 0:04:47,040
first we can install the y axis rail to

124
0:04:47,040 --> 0:04:49,680
the central plate using three bolts

125
0:04:49,680 --> 0:04
then we can install the two nema 17

126
0:04 --> 0:04:53,360
stepper motors

127
0:04:53,360 --> 0:04:55,680
one goes on the top side and the other

128
0:04:55,680 --> 0:04:58,320
goes at the bottom side of the plate

129
0:04:58,320 --> 0:05:00,800
as i mentioned earlier we need some m5

130
0:05:00,800 --> 0:05:03,199
bolts and nuts for installing the gt2

131
0:05:03,199 --> 0:05:04,800
pulleys in place

132
0:05:04,800 --> 0:05:07,039
the two pulleys here are actually idler

133
0:05:07,039 --> 0:05:08,960
pulleys which are used for providing

134
0:05:08,960 --> 0:05:12,080
grip for the x-axis gt2 belt and the

135
0:05:12,080 --> 0:05:14,160
tooth pulley which goes on the stepper

136
0:05:14,160 --> 0:05:15,440
motor

137
0:05:15,440 --> 0:05:17,520
as for installing that pulley we should

138
0:05:17,520 --> 0:05:19,280
measure and level it according to the

139
0:05:19,280 --> 0:05:20,960
idler pulleys

140
0:05:20,960 --> 0:05:23,919
as for the y-axis we only need one idler

141
0:05:23,919 --> 0:05
pulley which goes on the other side of

142
0:05 --> 0:05:28,560
the rail as the belt for this axis will

143
0:05:28,560 --> 0:05:30,720
be installed in a loop

144
0:05:30,720 --> 0:05:32,960
okay next is the marriage or connecting

145
0:05:32,960 --> 0:05:34,960
the two axes together

146
0:05:34,960 --> 0:05:36,960
we simply do that by securing the

147
0:05:36,960 --> 0:05:39,520
central plate to the x-axis sliding

148
0:05:39,520 --> 0:05:42,320
block using 4 m3 bolts

149
0:05:42,320 --> 0:05:45,039
with this the machine got its main shape

150
0:05:45,039 --> 0:05:47,520
and now the y-axis sliding block can

151
0:05:47,520 --> 0:05:50,400
reach any position in the work area

152
0:05:50,400 --> 0:05:52,800
we can continue with assembling the pen

153
0:05:52,800 --> 0:05:54,400
lifter mechanism

154
0:05:54,400 --> 0:05:57,280
this mechanism is composed of two parts

155
0:05:57,280 --> 0:05:59,919
one fixed that's bolted to the y-axis

156
0:05:59,919 --> 0:06
sliding block and the other one that

157
0:06 --> 0:06:04,400
will be sliding up and down

158
0:06:04,400 --> 0:06:07,039
once the fixed part is secured in place

159
0:06:07,039 --> 0:06:09,600
we can install the z-axis stepper motor

160
0:06:09,600 --> 0:06:10,479
on it

161
0:06:10,479 --> 0:06:13,360
this stepper is also nema 17 but it's

162
0:06:13,360 --> 0:06:16,160
shorter 23 millimeters instead of 40

163
0:06:16,160 --> 0:06:19,280
millimeters in order to cut on weight

164
0:06:19,280 --> 0:06:21,440
then we can install the lifter which is

165
0:06:21,440 --> 0:06:23,120
simply attached to the shaft of the

166
0:06:23,120 --> 0:06:24,160
stepper

167
0:06:24,160 --> 0:06:26,560
the grub screw that i hit was a bit long

168
0:06:26,560 --> 0:06:29,360
for it so i put the lifter to the shaft

169
0:06:29,360 --> 0:06:31,919
without it but its hole has a shape as

170
0:06:31,919 --> 0:06:33,919
the shaft so the motion will be

171
0:06:33,919 --> 0:06:35,440
transferred well

172
0:06:35,440 --> 0:06:37,520
i actually ended up modifying this part

173
0:06:37,520 --> 0:06:39,759
a little bit but no worries you will get

174
0:06:39,759 --> 0:06:41,600
the updated version of it in the

175
0:06:41,600 --> 0:06:43,600
download files

176
0:06:43,600 --> 0:06:46,080
next i inserted the four linear bearings

177
0:06:46,080 --> 0:06:48,800
into the sliding part and secured the

178
0:06:48,800 --> 0:06:51,120
micro servo in place

179
0:06:51,120 --> 0:06:53,360
then i also secured the pen porter

180
0:06:53,360 --> 0:06:56,560
holder part right next to the servo

181
0:06:56,560 --> 0:06:58,800
for connecting the fixed and the sliding

182
0:06:58,800 --> 0:07:01,440
parts together first we need to pass the

183
0:07:01,440 --> 0:07:04,479
servo wire to a hole in the fixed part

184
0:07:04,479 --> 0:07:07,199
and then insert the six millimeters rods

185
0:07:07,199 --> 0:07:09,759
from the top through the bearings and

186
0:07:09,759 --> 0:07:11,919
through the fixed part hole

187
0:07:11,919 --> 0:07:13,840
while installing the rod we should also

188
0:07:13,840 --> 0:07:16,400
insert a spring in between the fixed and

189
0:07:16,400 --> 0:07:19,039
the sliding part in a way that it pushes

190
0:07:19,039 --> 0:07:21,520
the sliding part down this will help the

191
0:07:21,520 --> 0:07:23,280
pen to have a better contact with the

192
0:07:23,280 --> 0:07:24,800
work surface

193
0:07:24,800 --> 0:07:26,960
at the bottom side of the fixed part

194
0:07:26,960 --> 0:07:28,880
there are openings where we can insert

195
0:07:28,880 --> 0:07:31,520
m3 nuts and use them for securing these

196
0:07:31,520 --> 0:07:34,240
six millimeters rods in place

197
0:07:34,240 --> 0:07:37,039
next we can assemble the pen holder unit

198
0:07:37,039 --> 0:07:39,360
that goes on one side of the machine

199
0:07:39,360 --> 0:07:41,680
it's composed of top and a bottom part

200
0:07:41,680 --> 0:07:44,240
with openings that can accommodate up to

201
0:07:44,240 --> 0:07:45,919
12 pence

202
0:07:45,919 --> 0:07:48,639
i continued with installing the belts

203
0:07:48,639 --> 0:07:50,639
first we need to measure how much length

204
0:07:50,639 --> 0:07:53,919
we need and cut it approximately to size

205
0:07:53,919 --> 0:07:55,840
for attaching the belt to the sliding

206
0:07:55,840 --> 0:07:58,960
block i made this cool belt connectors

207
0:07:58,960 --> 0:08:01,039
where the belt goes around a hollow

208
0:08:01,039 --> 0:08:03,520
shaft and in between two walls that

209
0:08:03,520 --> 0:08:05,919
doesn't allow the belt to move

210
0:08:05,919 --> 0:08:08,240
using an m3 bolt we can secure the first

211
0:08:08,240 --> 0:08:10,639
connector on one side of the block and

212
0:08:10,639 --> 0:08:12,560
repeat the same procedure for the other

213
0:08:12,560 --> 0:08:13,680
side

214
0:08:13,680 --> 0:08:15,520
we can move the connectors along these

215
0:08:15,520 --> 0:08:18,240
slots here and so tension the belt as

216
0:08:18,240 --> 0:08:19,919
much as we want

217
0:08:19,919 --> 0:08:22,720
as for the x-axis the belt will go in a

218
0:08:22,720 --> 0:08:25,440
straight line from one to the other side

219
0:08:25,440 --> 0:08:27,280
while passing through the pulleys in a

220
0:08:27,280 --> 0:08:29,840
way that they will provide tension or

221
0:08:29,840 --> 0:08:32,159
grip to the stepper motor pulley

222
0:08:32,159 --> 0:08:34,800
for tensioning the x-axis built i made

223
0:08:34,800 --> 0:08:36,959
these connectors that have a shape as

224
0:08:36,959 --> 0:08:39,760
the belt and so we can tie them to the

225
0:08:39,760 --> 0:08
sides of the machine

226
0:08 --> 0:08:44,640
next we can install the limit switches

227
0:08:44,640 --> 0:08:46,720
i actually ended up lowering a bit this

228
0:08:46,720 --> 0:08:49,839
z-axis limit switch and as for the x and

229
0:08:49,839 --> 0:08:52,399
the y limit switches i used the ones

230
0:08:52,399 --> 0:08:54,800
from my previous project which already

231
0:08:54,800 --> 0:08:57,040
had wires connected to them

232
0:08:57,040 --> 0:08:58,959
with this the mechanical part of this

233
0:08:58,959 --> 0:09:01,440
machine is ready and now we can move on

234
0:09:01,440 --> 0:09:03,839
with connecting the electronics

235
0:09:03,839 --> 0:09:05,920
as i mentioned we are using an arduino

236
0:09:05,920 --> 0:09:08,560
uno board in combination with a cnc

237
0:09:08,560 --> 0:09:09,959
shield and three

238
0:09:09,959 --> 0:09:12,640
a4988 stepper drivers

239
0:09:12,640 --> 0:09:14,240
for attaching the arduino board to the

240
0:09:14,240 --> 0:09:16,640
machine i made an additional 3d printed

241
0:09:16,640 --> 0:09:19,360
part that goes on the side panel

242
0:09:19,360 --> 0:09:21,839
i secured the arduino board with two m3

243
0:09:21,839 --> 0:09:24,399
bolts and on top of it i inserted the

244
0:09:24,399 --> 0:09:26,240
cnc shield

245
0:09:26,240 --> 0:09:28,640
here we need to insert three jumpers for

246
0:09:28,640 --> 0:09:30,959
each stepper driver in order to select

247
0:09:30,959 --> 0:09:33,839
16 stepped resolution and then insert

248
0:09:33,839 --> 0:09:36,480
the stepper drivers in place

249
0:09:36,480 --> 0:09:38,399
then we can connect the motors to the

250
0:09:38,399 --> 0:09:40,320
cnc appropriately

251
0:09:40,320 --> 0:09:42,160
for connecting the micro limit switches

252
0:09:42,160 --> 0:09:44,480
in place i simply soldered wires

253
0:09:44,480 --> 0:09:47,120
directly to them and on the other side i

254
0:09:47,120 --> 0:09:49,440
soldered female pin headers which i got

255
0:09:49,440 --> 0:09:52,080
them from some jump wires

256
0:09:52,080 --> 0:09:54,480
as for the servo motor i used some servo

257
0:09:54,480 --> 0:09:56,640
extension cables so that it can reach

258
0:09:56,640 --> 0:09:58,320
the cnc shield

259
0:09:58,320 --> 0:10:00,240
for powering the machine we need 12

260
0:10:00,240 --> 0:10
volts power supply

261
0:10 --> 0:10:04,320
nevertheless here's a circuit diagram of

262
0:10:04,320 --> 0:10:07,200
how everything needs to be connected

263
0:10:07,200 --> 0:10:09,120
there are a few final touches that needs

264
0:10:09,120 --> 0:10:11,360
to be done in order to complete this pin

265
0:10:11,360 --> 0:10:12,480
plotter

266
0:10:12,480 --> 0:10:14,640
here i'm installing the pen gripper

267
0:10:14,640 --> 0:10:16,480
which is simply attached to the servo

268
0:10:16,480 --> 0:10:19,120
motor through the servo horn

269
0:10:19,120 --> 0:10:21,200
for managing the cables from the pen

270
0:10:21,200 --> 0:10:23,839
plotter i used the dining table mat

271
0:10:23,839 --> 0:10:26,560
which material is firm but flexible so

272
0:10:26,560 --> 0:10:28,720
it was perfect for the job

273
0:10:28,720 --> 0:10:30,560
with this our drawing machine is

274
0:10:30,560 --> 0:10:33,120
actually completed however there are a

275
0:10:33,120 --> 0:10:35,440
few things that we should note here

276
0:10:35,440 --> 0:10
as the y-axis rail is unsupported on one

277
0:10 --> 0:10:41,040
side and the 3d printing pla material

278
0:10:41,040 --> 0:10:43,600
itself is not that rigid when fully

279
0:10:43,600 --> 0:10:45,839
extended the pin lifter was four

280
0:10:45,839 --> 0:10:47,839
millimeters lower compared to the

281
0:10:47,839 --> 0:10:49,440
supported side

282
0:10:49,440 --> 0:10:51,839
that's way too much play but i managed

283
0:10:51,839 --> 0:10:54,480
to solve that issue by lifting the front

284
0:10:54,480 --> 0:10:56,800
side of the machine a little bit

285
0:10:56,800 --> 0:10:58,959
in this way i reduced the difference to

286
0:10:58,959 --> 0:11:01,920
around 1 millimeter which was acceptable

287
0:11:01,920 --> 0:11:04,079
if you plan to use these big rails i

288
0:11:04,079 --> 0:11:06,320
would definitely suggest to support the

289
0:11:06,320 --> 0:11:09,440
y-axis rail on the other side as well

290
0:11:09,440 --> 0:11:11,760
another issue is the pin holder because

291
0:11:11,760 --> 0:11:14,160
the pins don't stay in place well in

292
0:11:14,160 --> 0:11:15,279
this way

293
0:11:15,279 --> 0:11:17,360
here i would suggest making the top

294
0:11:17,360 --> 0:11:19,760
openings bigger and add some soft

295
0:11:19,760 --> 0:11:22,240
material on the sides so that the pans

296
0:11:22,240 --> 0:11:24,560
can stay in place while being easy for

297
0:11:24,560 --> 0:11:26,959
the machine to insert them

298
0:11:26,959 --> 0:11:29,120
finally we can insert a board under the

299
0:11:29,120 --> 0:11:31,360
whole machine so that we get a nice and

300
0:11:31,360 --> 0:11:32,720
flat surface

301
0:11:32,720 --> 0:11:35,279
and that's it our machine is completed

302
0:11:35,279 --> 0:11:37,680
but what's left to do now is to give

303
0:11:37,680 --> 0:11:41,279
life to it or make it a real cnc machine

304
0:11:41,279 --> 0:11:43,360
for that purpose we need to install a

305
0:11:43,360 --> 0:11:45,600
firmware to the arduino for controlling

306
0:11:45,600 --> 0:11:48,320
the motion of the cnc machine and we

307
0:11:48,320 --> 0:11:50,240
need a control software through which we

308
0:11:50,240 --> 0:11:52,399
will send gcodes and tell the machine

309
0:11:52,399 --> 0:11:53,760
what to do

310
0:11:53,760 --> 0:11:56,240
the most popular choice for diy cnc

311
0:11:56,240 --> 0:11:58,320
machines is the open source gerbil

312
0:11:58,320 --> 0:11:59,519
firmware

313
0:11:59,519 --> 0:12:01,680
however for this pin plotter we need a

314
0:12:01,680 --> 0:12
modified version of it which can control

315
0:12 --> 0:12:06,800
the servo motor the modified version is

316
0:12:06,800 --> 0:12:09,440
called gerbil servo which alters the

317
0:12:09,440 --> 0:12:12,079
default pwm frequency of the spindle

318
0:12:12,079 --> 0:12:15,360
control pin or digital pin number 11

319
0:12:15,360 --> 0:12:18,399
from one kilohertz to 50 hertz which is

320
0:12:18,399 --> 0:12:20,320
needed for controlling this type of

321
0:12:20,320 --> 0:12:22,240
servo motors

322
0:12:22,240 --> 0:12:24,399
once we download and install this gerbil

323
0:12:24,399 --> 0:12:26,880
firmware into the library folder of our

324
0:12:26,880 --> 0:12:29,839
arduino ide we will also need to modify

325
0:12:29,839 --> 0:12:32,959
its config.h file in order to enable

326
0:12:32,959 --> 0:12:35,440
tree access homing instead of its

327
0:12:35,440 --> 0:12:38,320
default to axis homing and of course

328
0:12:38,320 --> 0:12:41,440
upload gerbil to the arduino

329
0:12:41,440 --> 0:12:43,760
as for the control software we will use

330
0:12:43,760 --> 0:12:46,160
the gerbil plotter which is a dedicated

331
0:12:46,160 --> 0:12:48,320
software for controlling plotters and

332
0:12:48,320 --> 0:12:50,480
includes a graphic converter through

333
0:12:50,480 --> 0:12:52,959
which we can generate g-code from our

334
0:12:52,959 --> 0:12:54,800
images or graphics

335
0:12:54,800 --> 0:12:56,800
this one is also open source which can

336
0:12:56,800 --> 0:12:59,680
be downloaded from github here the first

337
0:12:59,680 --> 0:13:01,519
thing that we need to do is to connect

338
0:13:01,519 --> 0:13:03,519
our arduino board to the software

339
0:13:03,519 --> 0:13:06,320
through the suitable com port once we

340
0:13:06,320 --> 0:13:08,320
click the kill alarm button on the

341
0:13:08,320 --> 0:13:10,800
serial monitor we'll get a list of our

342
0:13:10,800 --> 0:13:13,279
current gerbil parameters

343
0:13:13,279 --> 0:13:14,560
we need to change some of these

344
0:13:14,560 --> 0:13:17,120
parameters according to our machine

345
0:13:17,120 --> 0:13:18,720
the first thing that we should adjust

346
0:13:18,720 --> 0:13:21,360
here is the travel resolution or the

347
0:13:21,360 --> 0:13:23,760
steps per millimeter value

348
0:13:23,760 --> 0:13:26,079
these values indicate how many steps the

349
0:13:26,079 --> 0:13:28,639
motors should take in order to move one

350
0:13:28,639 --> 0:13:29,920
millimeter

351
0:13:29,920 --> 0:13:32,160
this depends on the type of the stepper

352
0:13:32,160 --> 0:13:34,720
motor that we have the selected step

353
0:13:34,720 --> 0:13:37,200
resolution and the motion transmission

354
0:13:37,200 --> 0:13:40,079
in this case the gt2 belt and the pulley

355
0:13:40,079 --> 0:13:42,720
for our machine a value of 80 steps per

356
0:13:42,720 --> 0:13:45,199
millimeter is needed for the x and the y

357
0:13:45,199 --> 0:13:46,959
axis to be accurate

358
0:13:46,959 --> 0:13:50,160
as for the z-axis i set a value of 40

359
0:13:50,160 --> 0:13:52,560
which is actually not accurate in terms

360
0:13:52,560 --> 0:13:54,959
of real motion but we cannot achieve

361
0:13:54,959 --> 0:13:57,120
that anyway with our reciprocating

362
0:13:57,120 --> 0:13
motion

363
0:13 --> 0:14:00,240
we should also set the parameter number

364
0:14:00,240 --> 0:14
23 to 0 which describes where our limit

365
0:14 --> 0:14:05,920
switches are located

366
0:14:05,920 --> 0:14:09,040
set the maximum feed rate acceleration

367
0:14:09,040 --> 0:14:11,120
maximum travel speed and set the

368
0:14:11,120 --> 0:14:14,480
parameter number 1 to a value of 255

369
0:14:14,480 --> 0:14:16,560
which enables the steppers to be active

370
0:14:16,560 --> 0:14:17,680
all the time

371
0:14:17,680 --> 0:14:19,360
however we should note that with this

372
0:14:19,360 --> 0:14:22,240
being enabled especially for the z-axis

373
0:14:22,240 --> 0:14:24,720
taper we should adjust the current limit

374
0:14:24,720 --> 0:14:27,120
of the driver to minimum because the

375
0:14:27,120 --> 0:14:29,279
shorter nema 70 stepper motor can

376
0:14:29,279 --> 0:14:31,839
quickly get hot nevertheless for more

377
0:14:31,839 --> 0:14:34,160
details about configuring the gerbil you

378
0:14:34,160 --> 0:14:36,320
can always check the website article

379
0:14:36,320 --> 0:14
where you can find links to more

380
0:14 --> 0:14:39,440
resources

381
0:14:39,440 --> 0:14:41,040
ok so let's take a look at the

382
0:14:41,040 --> 0:14:43,519
controller setup now there are so many

383
0:14:43,519 --> 0:14:45,920
options to adjust here that it can be a

384
0:14:45,920 --> 0:14:48,399
bit intimidating at the beginning now i

385
0:14:48,399 --> 0:14:49,920
will quickly talk about the most

386
0:14:49,920 --> 0:14:51,839
important parameters and for more

387
0:14:51,839 --> 0:14:53,839
details as always you can check the

388
0:14:53,839 --> 0:14:55,600
website article

389
0:14:55,600 --> 0:14:58,160
here first we need to set the pen up and

390
0:14:58,160 --> 0:15:01,199
down translation to be the z-axis and

391
0:15:01,199 --> 0:15:04,639
set values for the up and down position

392
0:15:04,639 --> 0:15:07,440
in the tool table tab we can define the

393
0:15:07,440 --> 0:15
pins color and their positions

394
0:15 --> 0:15
we should note here that these values

395
0:15 --> 0:15:14,880
are for the g53 or the machine

396
0:15:14,880 --> 0:15:16,639
coordinate system

397
0:15:16,639 --> 0:15:18,480
this means that they are defined by the

398
0:15:18,480 --> 0:15:20,240
hard limit switches that the machine

399
0:15:20,240 --> 0:15:23,040
have and the maximum travel that we set

400
0:15:23,040 --> 0:15:25,760
in the gerbil parameters earlier

401
0:15:25,760 --> 0:15:27,920
for defining the position of each pen i

402
0:15:27,920 --> 0:15:30,880
used the offset values which are 0 for

403
0:15:30,880 --> 0:15:34,639
the x and 277 for the y-axis in this

404
0:15:34,639 --> 0:15:35,600
case

405
0:15:35,600 --> 0:15:37,920
these values position the gripper in

406
0:15:37,920 --> 0:15:40,320
front of the first pen and then i just

407
0:15:40,320 --> 0:15:43,360
had to define the y values for each pen

408
0:15:43,360 --> 0:15:46,079
which is 21.7 millimeters in the

409
0:15:46,079 --> 0:15:48,720
negative direction for each consecutive

410
0:15:48,720 --> 0:15:49,519
pen

411
0:15:49,519 --> 0:15:51,680
here we can also adjust the feed rate

412
0:15:51,680 --> 0:15:53,680
and the up and down position for each

413
0:15:53,680 --> 0:15:55,680
pen individually in case there are

414
0:15:55,680 --> 0:15:57,440
different pens

415
0:15:57,440 --> 0:15:59,759
next in the tool change tab we should

416
0:15:59,759 --> 0:16:02,759
select the perform tool change on

417
0:16:02,759 --> 0:16
txm06 which tells the machine to do the

418
0:16 --> 0:16:08,240
tool change when this command appears in

419
0:16:08,240 --> 0:16:09,759
the g-code

420
0:16:09,759 --> 0:16:12,639
the x-value after the letter t indicates

421
0:16:12,639 --> 0:16:15,600
the tool number from the tool table

422
0:16:15,600 --> 0:16:17,920
to perform the tool change we must

423
0:16:17,920 --> 0:16:20,720
include a select and remove scripts

424
0:16:20,720 --> 0:16:24,160
which are executed when this tx m06

425
0:16:24,160 --> 0:16:25,519
command appear

426
0:16:25,519 --> 0:16:27,920
in these scripts we define the movement

427
0:16:27,920 --> 0:16:30,079
of the gripper in order to take or

428
0:16:30,079 --> 0:16:31,600
remove a tool

429
0:16:31,600 --> 0:16:33,839
for selecting a pen the gripper is first

430
0:16:33,839 --> 0:16:35,759
positioned in the front of the actual

431
0:16:35,759 --> 0:16:38,560
pin in absolute machine coordinates the

432
0:16:38,560 --> 0:16:41,279
one defined in the tool table

433
0:16:41,279 --> 0:16:43,839
then the servo opens the gripper it

434
0:16:43,839 --> 0:16:46,800
moves up four more millimeters then move

435
0:16:46,800 --> 0:16:49,440
towards the pen in x direction and a

436
0:16:49,440 --> 0:16:51,920
little bit in y direction

437
0:16:51,920 --> 0:16:55,040
then the gripper closes lifts the pen up

438
0:16:55,040 --> 0:16:57,040
and move back to the same position

439
0:16:57,040 --> 0:16:59,600
before executing the script

440
0:16:59,600 --> 0:17:02,079
for removing the pen the script steps

441
0:17:02,079 --> 0:17:04,799
are the same but in reverse order

442
0:17:04,799 --> 0:17:06,880
of course all of these parameters depend

443
0:17:06,880 --> 0:17:09,760
on the pens themself their dimension and

444
0:17:09,760 --> 0:17:12,079
the dimension of the holders

445
0:17:12,079 --> 0:17:14,559
the only way to get this process correct

446
0:17:14,559 --> 0:17:17,600
is by testing and correcting the values

447
0:17:17,600 --> 0:17:19,360
finally let's take a look how we can

448
0:17:19,360 --> 0:17:21,839
generate g-codes from images with this

449
0:17:21,839 --> 0:17:23,919
gerbil plotter software

450
0:17:23,919 --> 0:17:26,480
once we load an image we can click on

451
0:17:26,480 --> 0:17:29,600
preview with colors from table so we can

452
0:17:29,600 --> 0:17:32,160
see how the image would look like from

453
0:17:32,160 --> 0:17:34,559
the image correction tab then we can

454
0:17:34,559 --> 0:17:37,600
play with the brightness contrast gamma

455
0:17:37,600 --> 0:17:39,760
and saturation values in order to

456
0:17:39,760 --> 0:17:42,720
achieve colors similar to the real image

457
0:17:42,720 --> 0:17:45,520
or the one that we actually want

458
0:17:45,520 --> 0:17:47,360
we can set the output size in

459
0:17:47,360 --> 0:17
millimeters and in the color replacing

460
0:17 --> 0:17:52,320
tab we can remove the colors that we

461
0:17:52,320 --> 0:17:53,840
don't want to use

462
0:17:53,840 --> 0:17:56,080
for example we can remove the apricot

463
0:17:56,080 --> 0:17
color which is the white color in the

464
0:17 --> 0:17:59,039
image

465
0:17:59,039 --> 0:18:01,600
then we can just click on create g-code

466
0:18:01,600 --> 0:18:04,960
button and the g-code will be generated

467
0:18:04,960 --> 0:18:07,520
we can also generate g-codes from svg

468
0:18:07,520 --> 0:18:10,160
files which we can just drag and drop

469
0:18:10,160 --> 0:18:12,480
them and the software will generate the

470
0:18:12,480 --> 0:18:14,640
g-code right away

471
0:18:14,640 --> 0:18:16,799
before we start the plotting we should

472
0:18:16,799 --> 0:18:19,120
set the zero position wherever we want

473
0:18:19,120 --> 0:18
in the work area and then click the play

474
0:18 --> 0:18:23,120
button

475
0:18:23,120 --> 0:18:25,600
the machine will start working and so we

476
0:18:25,600 --> 0:18:28,559
can enjoy watching it making magic i

477
0:18:28,559 --> 0:18:30,240
hope you enjoyed this video and learned

478
