0:00:01,439 --> 0:00:03,120
hello

2
0:00:03,120 --> 0:00:04,880
choo-choo

3
0:00:04,880 --> 0:00:06,240
welcome to another coding challenge

4
0:00:06,240 --> 0:00:07,600
video i am i want to let you know

5
0:00:07,600 --> 0:00:09,120
something before i get started thinking

6
0:00:09,120 --> 0:00:10,480
about changing the name of the coding

7
0:00:10,480 --> 0:00:12,320
challenges to me the idea of a challenge

8
0:00:12,320 --> 0:00:14,320
is something you have to beat

9
0:00:14,320 --> 0:00:16,480
or like defeat i want something more

10
0:00:16,480 --> 0:00:18,800
exploratory and collaborative and train

11
0:00:18,800 --> 0:00:20,560
themed like a maybe a journey but i

12
0:00:20,560 --> 0:00:21,840
don't know if that works if you got any

13
0:00:21,840 --> 0:00:24,160
ideas let me know in the comments we'd

14
0:00:24,160 --> 0:00:26,560
love to hear what should these be called

15
0:00:26,560 --> 0:00:29,679
going forward but today boy do i have an

16
0:00:29,679 --> 0:00:31,760
exciting one for you it is one

17
0:00:31,760 --> 0:00:34,320
that i made during a live stream uh

18
0:00:34,320 --> 0:00:36,640
about a year ago translating an image's

19
0:00:36,640 --> 0:00:39,040
pixels to ascii characters like you're

20
0:00:39,040 --> 0:00:41,040
seeing right here so i want to do this

21
0:00:41,040 --> 0:00:43,280
again i bear i have no memory of doing

22
0:00:43,280 --> 0:00:44,960
this a year ago so i'm kind of starting

23
0:00:44,960 --> 0:00:46,960
fresh we'll see if the result i get is

24
0:00:46,960 --> 0:00:48,960
the same as what i have here and then

25
0:00:48,960 --> 0:00:50,480
hopefully you will make your own

26
0:00:50,480 --> 0:00:52,719
creative version of this and share it

27
0:00:52,719 --> 0:00
with me

28
0:00 --> 0:00:55,520
on the coding train website or in the

29
0:00:55,520 --> 0:00:57,360
comments or on social media or all the

30
0:00:57,360 --> 0:00:58,960
ways people share things with each other

31
0:00:58,960 --> 0:01:01,440
let's get started first i would like to

32
0:01:01,440 --> 0:01:02,879
thank

33
0:01:02,879 --> 0:01:08,240
ert

34
0:01:08,240 --> 0:01:11,040
this is a wonderful example i believe of

35
0:01:11,040 --> 0:01:13,840
some shader code to render

36
0:01:13,840 --> 0:01:16,880
some beautiful ascii art and it all

37
0:01:16,880 --> 0:01:19,600
relies entirely on this

38
0:01:19,600 --> 0:01:22,560
array of characters this array of

39
0:01:22,560 --> 0:01:25,520
characters is ordered from

40
0:01:25,520 --> 0:01:28,960
either brightest to darkest or darkest

41
0:01:28,960 --> 0:01:30,960
to brightest depending on what color

42
0:01:30,960 --> 0:01:32,320
you're sort of rendering the background

43
0:01:32,320 --> 0:01:35,280
or the character so i believe that what

44
0:01:35,280 --> 0:01:38,240
i can do oh let's use the whiteboard so

45
0:01:38,240 --> 0:01:39,759
the idea is that i have an image and

46
0:01:39,759 --> 0:01:41,840
maybe i'll start like i did a year ago

47
0:01:41,840 --> 0:01:48,720
with an image of a kitten

48
0:01:48,720 --> 0:01:52,159
now every pixel of an image has an rgb

49
0:01:52,159 --> 0:01
value

50
0:01 --> 0:01:56,079
typically the rgb values are stored as

51
0:01:56,079 --> 0:02:00,560
numbers between 0 and 255.

52
0:02:00,560 --> 0:02:03,119
if i want to get a brightness value for

53
0:02:03,119 --> 0:02:05,840
a given pixel the higher the number the

54
0:02:05,840 --> 0:02:07,920
more the color there is the more red the

55
0:02:07,920 --> 0:02:10,399
more green the more blue if all of those

56
0:02:10,399 --> 0:02:12,879
values are all the way up to 255 we've

57
0:02:12,879 --> 0:02:15,520
got white so the higher the numbers the

58
0:02:15,520 --> 0:02:17,680
brighter the pixel if i wanted to have

59
0:02:17,680 --> 0:02:19,520
one number to represent the brightness

60
0:02:19,520 --> 0:02:21,360
of a given pixel the sort of grayscale

61
0:02:21,360 --> 0:02:23,520
value of that pixel one way i could do

62
0:02:23,520 --> 0:02:28,560
that is by averaging these three values

63
0:02:28,560 --> 0:02:30,160
now there are more sophisticated

64
0:02:30,160 --> 0:02:32,640
algorithms for taking an rgb value and

65
0:02:32,640 --> 0:02:34,640
translating it into a black and white

66
0:02:34,640 --> 0:02:37,599
image a brightness value

67
0:02:37,599 --> 0:02:39,280
maybe i'll investigate that as i get

68
0:02:39,280 --> 0:02:40,800
further along with this project but i

69
0:02:40,800 --> 0:02:42,640
think i'm going to get a good enough

70
0:02:42,640 --> 0:02:45,599
effect just with the average so let's

71
0:02:45,599 --> 0:02:47,920
say that any one of these pixels let's

72
0:02:47,920 --> 0:02:49,200
pick this one

73
0:02:49,200 --> 0:02:50,959
let's say that its brightness value

74
0:02:50,959 --> 0:02:52,160
happens to be

75
0:02:52,160 --> 0:02:55,040
137

76
0:02:55,040 --> 0:02:57,040
now if you'll come with me back over to

77
0:02:57,040 --> 0:02:59,920
my computer screen

78
0:02:59,920 --> 0:03:02,319
let me remind you again of this string

79
0:03:02,319 --> 0:03:04,640
of characters called density do you

80
0:03:04,640 --> 0:03:06,560
think is there any chance i could write

81
0:03:06,560 --> 0:03:09,440
out all of those in the same order on my

82
0:03:09,440 --> 0:03:11,440
whiteboard over there almost none but

83
0:03:11,440 --> 0:03:18,159
i'm gonna try to do it anyway

84
0:03:18,159 --> 0:03:22,080
mark estimation abc oh no i ran out of

85
0:03:22,080 --> 0:03:24,799
room i did not plan this well

86
0:03:24,799 --> 0:03:26,560
close enough that keeps going maybe i'll

87
0:03:26,560 --> 0:03
maybe it'll be fixed who knows i don't

88
0:03 --> 0:03:29,120
know what you're seeing because it's

89
0:03:29,120 --> 0:03:30,959
like a magic thing happens after i do

90
0:03:30,959 --> 0:03:33,360
this it's amazing if we're looking at

91
0:03:33,360 --> 0:03:35,599
this like first of all there are so many

92
0:03:35,599 --> 0:03:38,159
possible one beautiful abstract

93
0:03:38,159 --> 0:03:40,720
generative kinds of images we could make

94
0:03:40,720 --> 0:03:43,280
just using these ascii characters so i

95
0:03:43,280 --> 0:03:44,959
would encourage you to go in that

96
0:03:44,959 --> 0:03:46,400
direction but i'm going to go in a

97
0:03:46,400 --> 0:03:48,400
different direction which is to say the

98
0:03:48,400 --> 0:03:51,440
denser the character the more pixels it

99
0:03:51,440 --> 0:03:54,080
uses i'm going to match that to a bright

100
0:03:54,080 --> 0:03:55,120
pixel

101
0:03:55,120 --> 0:03:57,360
so essentially i could create some sort

102
0:03:57,360 --> 0:03:58,640
of mapping

103
0:03:58,640 --> 0:04:01,760
where if the color is 255 the brightness

104
0:04:01,760 --> 0:04:04,159
value then i would render this

105
0:04:04,159 --> 0:04:06,480
particular character if the brightness

106
0:04:06,480 --> 0:04:08,959
value were zero i would render whatever

107
0:04:08,959 --> 0:04:11,439
character i didn't get to down here and

108
0:04:11,439 --> 0:04:14,400
then 137 would be appropriately

109
0:04:14,400 --> 0:04:16,720
somewhere here so like 127 would be

110
0:04:16,720 --> 0:04:19,840
exactly in the middle so maybe 137 this

111
0:04:19,840 --> 0:04:22,400
is like highly approximate might be this

112
0:04:22,400 --> 0:04:25,199
character would get drawn over here to

113
0:04:25,199 --> 0:04:28,479
represent you know the uh ear of this

114
0:04:28,479 --> 0:04:31,840
particular cat who is now sadly in jail

115
0:04:31,840 --> 0:04:33,600
oh that poor cousin let's play we got to

116
0:04:33,600 --> 0:04:35,759
let the cat out cat go free

117
0:04:35,759 --> 0:04:36,639
run

118
0:04:36,639 --> 0:04:38,479
like the wind

119
0:04:38,479 --> 0:04:41,040
go so the first thing i'm going to do is

120
0:04:41,040 --> 0:04:43,919
take this string of characters and bring

121
0:04:43,919 --> 0:04:47,280
it into my own p5.js sketch

122
0:04:47,280 --> 0:04:48,720
now in case for some reason this is the

123
0:04:48,720 --> 0:04:49,759
first time you're ever watching the

124
0:04:49,759 --> 0:04:52,080
coding train this is p5.js a javascript

125
0:04:52,080 --> 0:04:53,199
library for

126
0:04:53,199 --> 0:04:55,040
creative coding images animations and

127
0:04:55,040 --> 0:04:57,040
all sorts of wonderful beautiful stuff

128
0:04:57,040 --> 0:04:59,440
find out more at p5js.org

129
0:04:59,440 --> 0:05:00,800
i also want to point out that i'm trying

130
0:05:00,800 --> 0:05:02,400
to get in the habit a little bit more

131
0:05:02,400 --> 0:05:04,479
about when i declare a variable that i

132
0:05:04,479 --> 0:05:06,800
know isn't going to ever change i'm

133
0:05:06,800 --> 0:05:09,440
going to use const instead of let oh i

134
0:05:09,440 --> 0:05:12,160
forgot to talk about the timer

135
0:05:12,160 --> 0:05:13,680
has there been a timer going this whole

136
0:05:13,680 --> 0:05:16,720
time i hope so good it's usually now

137
0:05:16,720 --> 0:05:18,400
over here that's where it is it should

138
0:05:18,400 --> 0:05:19,600
be there how long i've been doing this

139
0:05:19,600 --> 0:05:21,440
for like seven and a half hours even

140
0:05:21,440 --> 0:05:22,400
though you've only been watching this

141
0:05:22,400 --> 0:05:24,400
for 10 minutes or whatever it is right

142
0:05:24,400 --> 0:05:26,880
now before i start trying to load a

143
0:05:26,880 --> 0:05:29,919
video into my p5 just sketch i have got

144
0:05:29,919 --> 0:05:33,440
this nice little photo of gloria pickle

145
0:05:33,440 --> 0:05:35,759
dog and i quickly just removed the

146
0:05:35,759 --> 0:05:37,440
background from the image in photoshop

147
0:05:37,440 --> 0:05:39,120
which i think will make the ascii

148
0:05:39,120 --> 0:05:41,440
version of this image pop a bit more

149
0:05:41,440 --> 0:05:43,039
in terms of what i'm about to try to do

150
0:05:43,039 --> 0:05:46,639
so um i uploaded a very small 48 by 48

151
0:05:46,639 --> 0:05:50,400
pixel size image to this p5 uh project

152
0:05:50,400 --> 0:05
i've got a separate video about how to

153
0:05 --> 0:05:53,520
upload files to the editor if that's

154
0:05:53,520 --> 0:05:55,120
something that you haven't done before

155
0:05:55,120 --> 0:05:57,280
and then all i need to do is add a

156
0:05:57,280 --> 0:06:04,560
preload function to load the image

157
0:06:04,560 --> 0:06:06,479
and we can see that gloria has been

158
0:06:06,479 --> 0:06:08,479
loaded it's kind of fuzzy it's blurry

159
0:06:08,479 --> 0:06
because i'm using this very low

160
0:06 --> 0:06:11,919
resolution version that's going to make

161
0:06:11,919 --> 0:06:14,080
translating it over to ascii easier of

162
0:06:14,080 --> 0:06
course i could work with altering the

163
0:06 --> 0:06:18,400
scale within the code itself but i think

164
0:06:18,400 --> 0:06:20,240
the demonstrations could be much easier

165
0:06:20,240 --> 0:06
if it is a one-to-one napping each pixel

166
0:06 --> 0:06:26,560
gets one character

167
0:06:26,560 --> 0:06:29,120
the next step that i need to do is write

168
0:06:29,120 --> 0:06:31,759
an algorithm to walk through and look at

169
0:06:31,759 --> 0:06
the brightness of every single pixel

170
0:06 --> 0:06:45,520
within this image

171
0:06:45,520 --> 0:06:48,720
now this is probably a block of code

172
0:06:48,720 --> 0:06:51,120
that i have typed in countless numbers

173
0:06:51,120 --> 0:06:53,680
of videos and explained it over and over

174
0:06:53,680 --> 0:06:55,759
again i do have an entire video all

175
0:06:55,759 --> 0:06:59,199
about how the pixel array works in p5.js

176
0:06:59,199 --> 0:07:00,720
so i would look at that if you want all

177
0:07:00,720 --> 0:07:02,160
of the details but just to give you the

178
0:07:02,160 --> 0:07:04,479
quick high level points every single

179
0:07:04,479 --> 0:07:09,759
pixel has an rgb value as well as an

180
0:07:09,759 --> 0:07:12,080
alpha value the alpha dealing with

181
0:07:12,080 --> 0:07:14,960
transparency so i am not worrying about

182
0:07:14,960 --> 0:07:16,479
transparency for this particular

183
0:07:16,479 --> 0:07:18,560
application but i do have to account for

184
0:07:18,560 --> 0:07:21,280
that within the pixel array every single

185
0:07:21,280 --> 0:07:25,280
pixel we can think of as having a number

186
0:07:25,280 --> 0:07:32,880
zero through the end of the image

187
0:07:32,880 --> 0:07:35,360
so in this case with this five by five

188
0:07:35,360 --> 0:07:39,039
image there's 25 pixels but since every

189
0:07:39,039 --> 0:07:40,479
single pixel

190
0:07:40,479 --> 0:07:43,680
has four numbers associated with it the

191
0:07:43,680 --> 0:07:45,440
actual array

192
0:07:45,440 --> 0:07:49,039
storing all the information is rgba

193
0:07:49,039 --> 0:07:50,800
for pixel 0

194
0:07:50,800 --> 0:07:52,960
then rgba

195
0:07:52,960 --> 0:07:57,360
for pixel 1 then rgba for pixel 2 etc

196
0:07:57,360 --> 0:08:00,639
etc so that translates back to

197
0:08:00,639 --> 0:08:02,879
this really nice formula where i can say

198
0:08:02,879 --> 0:08
the column plus the row times the width

199
0:08 --> 0:08:09,599
times 4 gives me the red value for any

200
0:08:09,599 --> 0:08:12,240
given column and row pixel and then i

201
0:08:12,240 --> 0:08:14,319
could get the green value by going one

202
0:08:14,319 --> 0:08:16,720
spot later and the red the blue value

203
0:08:16,720 --> 0:08:19,280
sorry by going two spots later so i kind

204
0:08:19,280 --> 0:08:21,520
of just explained the whole thing uh it

205
0:08:21,520 --> 0:08:23,120
might not have total made sense to you

206
0:08:23,120 --> 0:08:24,560
what i would suggest if this is

207
0:08:24,560 --> 0:08:26,319
confusing to you go find a piece of

208
0:08:26,319 --> 0:08:28,400
graph paper or any regular paper make

209
0:08:28,400 --> 0:08:30,479
your own little five by five image and

210
0:08:30,479 --> 0:08:32,479
just try numbering everything and trying

211
0:08:32,479 --> 0:08:34,479
things manually that's really the way i

212
0:08:34,479 --> 0:08:36,240
learned this stuff and kind of was able

213
0:08:36,240 --> 0:08:37,599
to wrap my head around it and you can

214
0:08:37,599 --> 0:08:39,120
also check out that other video where i

215
0:08:39,120 --> 0:08:40,719
explain it in more detail just to make

216
0:08:40,719 --> 0:08:42,399
sure this worked let me now try to draw

217
0:08:42,399 --> 0:08:44,720
every pixel as a square so first thing i

218
0:08:44,720 --> 0:08:46,640
need to do is figure out how what is the

219
0:08:46,640 --> 0:08:49,519
size of the squares

220
0:08:49,519 --> 0:08:51,120
for the moment i'm still working on this

221
0:08:51,120 --> 0:08:52,720
for canvas i'm going to try to switch

222
0:08:52,720 --> 0:08:54,160
over to making these dom elements at

223
0:08:54,160 --> 0:08:55,440
some point but i could just take the

224
0:08:55,440 --> 0:08:57,600
width of the canvas divided by the width

225
0:08:57,600 --> 0:08:59,120
of the actual image to know what that

226
0:08:59,120 --> 0:09:04,399
ratio is

227
0:09:04,399 --> 0:09:05,920
what did i do wrong

228
0:09:05,920 --> 0:09:07,519
what did i do wrong here i messed

229
0:09:07,519 --> 0:09:08,720
something up

230
0:09:08,720 --> 0:09:12,720
i guess i need to call load pixels

231
0:09:12,720 --> 0:09:15,680
ah i need to call load pixels so if i'm

232
0:09:15,680 --> 0:09:17,040
going to use the pixel array of that

233
0:09:17,040 --> 0:09:19,920
image i've gotta alert p5 to it and call

234
0:09:19,920 --> 0:09:21,920
load pixels so there you can see

235
0:09:21,920 --> 0:09:24,640
pixelated gloria i think for changing

236
0:09:24,640 --> 0:09:26,800
this into ascii having an even lower

237
0:09:26,800 --> 0:09:28,959
resolution image of gloria is going to

238
0:09:28,959 --> 0:09:30,720
improve things so i quickly made one

239
0:09:30,720 --> 0:09:33,040
that's just 20 by 20 and uploaded that

240
0:09:33,040 --> 0:09:34,959
and i'm using that instead now now again

241
0:09:34,959 --> 0:09:36,320
there's so many visualization

242
0:09:36,320 --> 0:09:38,560
possibilities we could do here with rgb

243
0:09:38,560 --> 0:09:40,560
color with multiple images with varying

244
0:09:40,560 --> 0:09:42,320
degrees of resolution

245
0:09:42,320 --> 0:09:44,800
i'm not gonna go down all of those roads

246
0:09:44,800 --> 0:09:46,560
it's a train it's a train it's not a car

247
0:09:46,560 --> 0:09:48,480
we're not driving on a road it's a train

248
0:09:48,480 --> 0:09:50,640
the track the train track i'm gonna

249
0:09:50,640 --> 0:09:53,440
follow is towards ascii so let's now

250
0:09:53,440 --> 0:09:55,279
look at the brightness value of each of

251
0:09:55,279 --> 0:09:57,760
these just by doing the average of rgb

252
0:09:57,760 --> 0:09:59,600
now there is a p5.js function called

253
0:09:59,600 --> 0:10:01,120
brightness we could try that and see if

254
0:10:01,120 --> 0:10:03,120
we get a different result um this is

255
0:10:03,120 --> 0:10:04,640
actually taking the color value and

256
0:10:04,640 --> 0:10:06,560
converting it to hue saturation

257
0:10:06,560 --> 0:10
brightness but just to keep things

258
0:10 --> 0:10:09,440
simple for me just going to do the

259
0:10:09,440 --> 0:10:12,959
average

260
0:10:12,959 --> 0:10:15,440
now we can see a grayscale version of

261
0:10:15,440 --> 0:10:18,959
gloria now to add text so what if i were

262
0:10:18,959 --> 0:10:21,200
instead of drawing a square we're just

263
0:10:21,200 --> 0:10:23,040
to draw an individual character just the

264
0:10:23,040 --> 0:10:27,200
character g for gloria

265
0:10:27,200 --> 0:10:30,079
let's not draw the image anymore

266
0:10:30,079 --> 0:10:32,480
let's make the font the size of the

267
0:10:32,480 --> 0:10:34,079
square

268
0:10:34,079 --> 0:10:36,560
and then i will need to shift everything

269
0:10:36,560 --> 0:10:38,480
down because i want the letter to appear

270
0:10:38,480 --> 0:10:43,360
in the center of the square

271
0:10:43,360 --> 0:10:45,120
i think this would probably more be much

272
0:10:45,120 --> 0:10:47,680
more clear if i use the black background

273
0:10:47,680 --> 0:10:49,920
and we could kind of see gloria peeking

274
0:10:49,920 --> 0:10:52,079
out there from all of those g's but

275
0:10:52,079 --> 0:10:54,160
again this is not what i want to do this

276
0:10:54,160 --> 0:10:55,440
is something i could do and there's

277
0:10:55,440 --> 0:10:57,360
plenty of possible outcomes maybe i

278
0:10:57,360 --> 0:10:59,120
could start writing some poetry or

279
0:10:59,120 --> 0:11:01,120
having the text change or pulling from a

280
0:11:01,120 --> 0:11:03,519
live data feed so many things but

281
0:11:03,519 --> 0:11:06,160
instead i want to take the brightness

282
0:11:06,160 --> 0:11:08,160
value and map it to one of these

283
0:11:08,160 --> 0:11:12,079
characters in my density string

284
0:11:12,079 --> 0:11:14,399
so i can get the length of the string

285
0:11:14,399 --> 0:11:16,320
so now i need the mapping to go from

286
0:11:16,320 --> 0:11
zero to that length or length minus one

287
0:11 --> 0:11:25,120
so that character index is

288
0:11:25,120 --> 0:11:27,120
take the brightness value which has a

289
0:11:27,120 --> 0:11:30,800
range between 0 and 255 and map that to

290
0:11:30,800 --> 0:11:32,880
some number between 0 and the length of

291
0:11:32,880 --> 0:11:35,279
the string ah but this is going to give

292
0:11:35,279 --> 0:11:38,120
me interim values like character

293
0:11:38,120 --> 0:11:41,120
3.1759 it's like kind of like pi but not

294
0:11:41,120 --> 0:11:42,399
i don't know why i picked that out of my

295
0:11:42,399 --> 0:11:45,279
head so i need to add the floor function

296
0:11:45,279 --> 0:11:47,200
to take the decimal off so i'm only

297
0:11:47,200 --> 0:11:49,440
getting the index to a particular value

298
0:11:49,440 --> 0:11:52,880
0 1 2 3.

299
0:11:52,880 --> 0:11:55,920
now instead of drawing g i can just draw

300
0:11:55,920 --> 0:11:59,519
that particular character

301
0:11:59,519 --> 0:12:01,519
and the point of this is for the

302
0:12:01,519 --> 0:12:05,040
brightness to come not from me setting

303
0:12:05,040 --> 0:12:06,959
the color of that character i'm drawing

304
0:12:06,959 --> 0:12:08,800
but from the contours the amount of

305
0:12:08,800 --> 0:12:10,560
pixels that shape of that character

306
0:12:10,560 --> 0:12:13,440
itself so now the fill shouldn't be tied

307
0:12:13,440 --> 0:12:16,240
to brightness it should just be 255 for

308
0:12:16,240 --> 0:12:19,360
all of them now do you see

309
0:12:19,360 --> 0:12:22,079
do we see gloria in there not so much

310
0:12:22,079 --> 0:12:24,079
just yet let's see if we can fiddle with

311
0:12:24,079 --> 0:12:26,880
this a bit one thing is this is inverted

312
0:12:26,880 --> 0:12:29,360
right so remember the brightest

313
0:12:29,360 --> 0:12:31,680
characters are at the front the

314
0:12:31,680 --> 0:12:33,360
beginning of the string and the darker

315
0:12:33,360 --> 0:12:35,519
ones are at the end so i want to reverse

316
0:12:35,519 --> 0:12:38,560
this to from length down to zero

317
0:12:38,560 --> 0:12:41,279
there now that looks quite a bit more

318
0:12:41,279 --> 0:12:43,760
like gloria i think there's an issue

319
0:12:43,760 --> 0:12:45,680
here with the spacing between the

320
0:12:45,680 --> 0:12:48,240
characters maybe i want to have the the

321
0:12:48,240 --> 0:12
spacing between the characters to be

322
0:12 --> 0:12:51,120
less

323
0:12:51,120 --> 0:12:52,320
i want to arrange them in a different

324
0:12:52,320 --> 0:12:53,760
way i want to use a different font a

325
0:12:53,760 --> 0:12:55,120
different scale

326
0:12:55,120 --> 0:12:57,440
but i think that this is going to be

327
0:12:57,440 --> 0:13:00,079
more effective to play with by changing

328
0:13:00,079 --> 0:13:03,519
this over from canvas to actual dom

329
0:13:03,519 --> 0:13:06,160
elements meaning i'm going to render the

330
0:13:06,160 --> 0:13:08,800
text on the web page itself rather than

331
0:13:08,800 --> 0:13:12,079
draw the pixels for text into a image a

332
0:13:12,079 --> 0:13:14,320
canvas image both have value depending

333
0:13:14,320 --> 0:13:15,680
on what application you might want to

334
0:13:15,680 --> 0:13:18,399
use this for but i'm just curious to see

335
0:13:18,399 --> 0:13:20,320
since i'm in the browser i could

336
0:13:20,320 --> 0:13:23,120
actually just copy paste my ascii art

337
0:13:23,120 --> 0:13:24,639
and put it into somewhere else that

338
0:13:24,639 --> 0:13:26,240
would be kind of fun to do i'm going to

339
0:13:26,240 --> 0:13:28,959
take a big leap of faith now and get rid

340
0:13:28,959 --> 0:13:33,600
of create canvas and type in no canvas

341
0:13:33,600 --> 0:13:36,320
i'm also going to remove the draw loop

342
0:13:36,320 --> 0:13
because i'm just rendering a static

343
0:13 --> 0:13:40,079
image now of course once i add video in

344
0:13:40,079 --> 0:13:42,959
a moment you know at about 17 hours into

345
0:13:42,959 --> 0:13:44,560
this video

346
0:13:44,560 --> 0:13:46,639
then i'll need to put the draw loop or

347
0:13:46,639 --> 0:13:49,120
some type of uh animation back in but

348
0:13:49,120 --> 0:13:50,800
right now i'm going to remove that one

349
0:13:50,800 --> 0:13:53,120
thing i'm curious about actually is can

350
0:13:53,120 --> 0:13:55,440
i get gloria to show up just in the

351
0:13:55,440 --> 0:13:56,560
console

352
0:13:56,560 --> 0:13:59,519
right because ultimately what i'm doing

353
0:13:59,519 --> 0:14:01,920
is for every row now i need to do the

354
0:14:01,920 --> 0:14:04,720
rows and i just realized that my

355
0:14:04,720 --> 0:14:07,440
algorithm is in reverse because i'm

356
0:14:07,440 --> 0:14:09,120
taking for every

357
0:14:09,120 --> 0:14:11,360
column no i need i need to do all of the

358
0:14:11,360 --> 0:14:13,600
columns in other words

359
0:14:13,600 --> 0:14:14,880
currently the way i've written those

360
0:14:14,880 --> 0:14:17,040
nested loops i'm going to this pixel

361
0:14:17,040 --> 0:14:18,639
then this pixel and this pixel and this

362
0:14:18,639 --> 0:14:20,560
pixel and this pixel then back up to

363
0:14:20,560 --> 0:14:23,920
here and what i want to do instead is go

364
0:14:23,920 --> 0:14:25,600
through all of the columns then down to

365
0:14:25,600 --> 0:14:27,120
the next row so i think i could just

366
0:14:27,120 --> 0:14:28,839
flip those two lines of

367
0:14:28,839 --> 0:14:31,600
code and then i can accumulate all of

368
0:14:31,600 --> 0:14
the characters into a string for each

369
0:14 --> 0:14:35,519
row

370
0:14:35,519 --> 0:14:41,519
there's no concept of drawing now

371
0:14:41,519 --> 0:14:44,240
just that row of characters and i

372
0:14:44,240 --> 0:14:46,079
believe then i should be able to just

373
0:14:46,079 --> 0:14:47,360
say

374
0:14:47,360 --> 0:14:49,760
console log row

375
0:14:49,760 --> 0:14:53,199
run the sketch

376
0:14:53,199 --> 0:14:55,920
that's kind of a squashed gloria right

377
0:14:55,920 --> 0:14:57,760
stretch it out can we like stretch out

378
0:14:57,760 --> 0:14:59,760
in post somehow just to like see it for

379
0:14:59,760 --> 0:15:02,320
a moment so the reason it's squashed is

380
0:15:02,320 --> 0:15:05,199
because each pixel takes up the same

381
0:15:05,199 --> 0:15:07,519
amount of space horizontally and

382
0:15:07,519 --> 0:15:09,120
vertically but

383
0:15:09,120 --> 0:15:12,240
these particular pixels are spread out

384
0:15:12,240 --> 0:15:14,079
there's more spacing between each line

385
0:15:14,079 --> 0:15:15,920
than there is between each character so

386
0:15:15,920 --> 0:15:17,360
i could have more control over

387
0:15:17,360 --> 0:15:19,600
manipulating that by rendering my own

388
0:15:19,600 --> 0:15:22,959
text into the browser page

389
0:15:22,959 --> 0:15:25,040
now i can't see it because i've got a

390
0:15:25,040 --> 0:15:26,399
dark gray background

391
0:15:26,399 --> 0:15
and very small characters that are black

392
0:15 --> 0:15:30,959
text so i can add some code into the css

393
0:15:30,959 --> 0:15:33,120
file to change the background color set

394
0:15:33,120 --> 0:15:38,880
the font and make the font larger

395
0:15:38,880 --> 0:15:41,199
now if you don't know css good we're in

396
0:15:41,199 --> 0:15:43,839
the same boat neither do i but i know

397
0:15:43,839 --> 0:15:45,440
enough to kind of make things work when

398
0:15:45,440 --> 0:15:47,279
i need to and i do have a video tutorial

399
0:15:47,279 --> 0:15:49,440
a bit about the basics of css that you

400
0:15:49,440 --> 0:15:51,360
could refer to one thing that's kind of

401
0:15:51,360 --> 0:15:53,040
critical here that i haven't addressed

402
0:15:53,040 --> 0:15:55,199
is that i'm using the font courier on

403
0:15:55,199 --> 0:15:57,279
purpose for me it's a little bit easier

404
0:15:57,279 --> 0:15:59,680
right now to just use a fixed width font

405
0:15:59,680 --> 0:16:01,600
meaning every character no matter what

406
0:16:01,600 --> 0:16:03,680
it is takes up the same amount of

407
0:16:03,680 --> 0:16:06,399
horizontal space um this makes just sort

408
0:16:06,399 --> 0:16:08,160
of the math of arranging the pixels much

409
0:16:08,160 --> 0:16:09,680
easier although it is an interesting

410
0:16:09,680 --> 0:16:11,519
problem to think about how we would do

411
0:16:11,519 --> 0:16:13,440
this without a fixed swift font that's

412
0:16:13,440 --> 0:16:14,720
something that you could take on as your

413
0:16:14,720 --> 0:16:17,120
own challenge perhaps i'm also noticing

414
0:16:17,120 --> 0:16:19,120
something a bit odd here which is that

415
0:16:19,120 --> 0:16
the contours of gloria are lost every

416
0:16 --> 0:16:24,240
single row starts all the way over at

417
0:16:24,240 --> 0:16:27,120
the left why is this well if we go back

418
0:16:27,120 --> 0:16:29,600
to here you might notice that this

419
0:16:29,600 --> 0:16:31,759
character at the very end of the density

420
0:16:31,759 --> 0:16:35,040
string is a space and if i put a space

421
0:16:35,040 --> 0:16:37,440
into a web page it's not actually going

422
0:16:37,440 --> 0:16:39,920
to necessarily render it unless it's in

423
0:16:39,920 --> 0:16:42,639
between characters in a particular way

424
0:16:42,639 --> 0:16:45,920
so what i need to do here is instead of

425
0:16:45,920 --> 0:16:48,240
rendering a space actually use the

426
0:16:48,240 --> 0:16:51,519
non-breaking space character thingymabob

427
0:16:51,519 --> 0:16
what is that

428
0:16 --> 0:16:57,199
ah it is an html entity which is a piece

429
0:16:57,199 --> 0:16:59,279
of text that begins with an ampersand it

430
0:16:59,279 --> 0:17:01,040
ends with a semicolon and there's

431
0:17:01,040 --> 0:17:04,559
different reserved ones like ampersand

432
0:17:04,559 --> 0:17:06,959
greater than less than there's one for

433
0:17:06,959 --> 0:17:08,720
non-breaking space character i forget

434
0:17:08,720 --> 0:17
what that is though what does it stand

435
0:17 --> 0:17:12,720
for non-breaking space i think it's just

436
0:17:12,720 --> 0:17:20,319
sp for space

437
0:17:20,319 --> 0:17:22,079
i think what i'll try to do is add the

438
0:17:22,079 --> 0:17:24,880
line height property to spring the lines

439
0:17:24,880 --> 0:17:28,480
a bit closer to each other

440
0:17:28,480 --> 0:17:31,120
if i make that 12 point okay that's much

441
0:17:31,120 --> 0:17:34,559
too overlapping

442
0:17:34,559 --> 0:17:36,160
that's a little bit better

443
0:17:36,160 --> 0:17:38,240
let me go back to the higher resolution

444
0:17:38,240 --> 0:17:39,120
image

445
0:17:39,120 --> 0:17:42,720
the one that was 48 by 48 pixels

446
0:17:42,720 --> 0:17:45,280
make a smaller font size

447
0:17:45,280 --> 0:17:47,440
and there we go you can see glory in

448
0:17:47,440 --> 0:17:49,039
there can't you

449
0:17:49,039 --> 0:17:51,440
don't you see gloria what i love about

450
0:17:51,440 --> 0:17:54,320
this now is i can take this hit copy

451
0:17:54,320 --> 0:17:56,880
make a just a plain text file and paste

452
0:17:56,880 --> 0:17:58,559
it in this is definitely looking much

453
0:17:58,559 --> 0:18:01,039
better kind of white on black let me try

454
0:18:01,039 --> 0:18:06,400
to recreate that in my version here

455
0:18:06,400 --> 0:18:07,520
ta-da

456
0:18:07,520 --> 0:18:10,400
gloria pickle as ascii art

457
0:18:10,400 --> 0:18:13,120
now i want to show you how easy i think

458
0:18:13,120 --> 0:18:16,720
this will be to take this from a static

459
0:18:16,720 --> 0:18:18,559
image to a video i have no idea where

460
0:18:18,559 --> 0:18:21,280
the timer is at right now but i expect

461
0:18:21,280 --> 0:18:23,360
that i'm gonna have it in the next

462
0:18:23,360 --> 0:18:25,760
minute or two instead of gloria let me

463
0:18:25,760 --> 0:18:28,080
make a variable called video

464
0:18:28,080 --> 0:18:30,720
no more preload

465
0:18:30,720 --> 0:18:34,080
there's my video image right now

466
0:18:34,080 --> 0:18:37,039
let me resize it to 48 by 48

467
0:18:37,039 --> 0:18:39,360
i'm going to add draw back in

468
0:18:39,360 --> 0:18:41,039
to use the draw loop even though there's

469
0:18:41,039 --> 0:18:43,120
no canvas i don't need these width and

470
0:18:43,120 --> 0:18:44,480
heights anymore i forgot about that

471
0:18:44,480 --> 0:18:47,360
because i'm not drawing

472
0:18:47,360 --> 0:18:51,360
this should be video

473
0:18:51,360 --> 0:18:53,600
hey i'm getting somewhere really fast

474
0:18:53,600 --> 0:18:56,960
and oh i've i've done a horrible thing

475
0:18:56,960 --> 0:18:59,200
so because i'm using creative i hit stop

476
0:18:59,200 --> 0:19:01,360
i just created image after image after

477
0:19:01,360 --> 0:19:03,200
image on the page so instead of using

478
0:19:03,200 --> 0:19:05,679
creative i need to update the text of

479
0:19:05,679 --> 0:19:06,799
each div

480
0:19:06,799 --> 0:19:08,559
i think this will also be easier if i

481
0:19:08,559 --> 0:19:10,960
just make one div that has line breaks

482
0:19:10,960 --> 0:19:12,960
in it rather than each row is a

483
0:19:12,960 --> 0:19:15,200
particular div you might be asking what

484
0:19:15,200 --> 0:19:16,960
is the div

485
0:19:16,960 --> 0:19:18,240
i'll include a link in the video's

486
0:19:18,240 --> 0:19:23,039
description with more info

487
0:19:23,039 --> 0:19:25,919
so now just one div that i'm going to

488
0:19:25,919 --> 0:19:28,400
display on the page so instead of each

489
0:19:28,400 --> 0:19:31,919
row being a separate string

490
0:19:31,919 --> 0:19:34,240
i'm just going to write

491
0:19:34,240 --> 0:19
a string called ascii image

492
0:19 --> 0:19:40,240
and accumulate all the text into ascii

493
0:19:40,240 --> 0:19:41,760
image and then

494
0:19:41,760 --> 0:19:45,440
after each row

495
0:19:45,440 --> 0:19:48,400
add the html tag for a line break i

496
0:19:48,400 --> 0:19:50,160
believe

497
0:19:50,160 --> 0:19:53,360
this should work

498
0:19:53,360 --> 0:19:55,840
okay well i need to update the div to

499
0:19:55,840 --> 0:19:59,679
include that text

500
0:19:59,679 --> 0:20:01,760
and we've done it

501
0:20:01,760 --> 0:20:03,200
we can stop the timer i mean we have

502
0:20:03,200 --> 0:20:04,559
some more things to say i want to clean

503
0:20:04,559 --> 0:20:06,559
this up a little bit but we can stop the

504
0:20:06,559 --> 0:20:08,400
timer this is pretty close to whatever i

505
0:20:08,400 --> 0:20:10,880
did a year ago looking at this i'd like

506
0:20:10,880 --> 0:20:12,880
to sort of see if i can fix this up a

507
0:20:12,880 --> 0:20:14,559
bit one of the things that i can

508
0:20:14,559 --> 0:20:17,840
immediately do is work with that string

509
0:20:17,840 --> 0:20:20,240
of characters that i have in my density

510
0:20:20,240 --> 0:20:22,960
string for example what i since i have

511
0:20:22,960 --> 0:20:25,280
this kind of locked in green background

512
0:20:25,280 --> 0:20:28,080
i think i can use many more blank

513
0:20:28,080 --> 0:20:31,360
characters blank spaces for uh darker

514
0:20:31,360 --> 0:20:32,880
characters

515
0:20:32,880 --> 0:20:34,720
so for example just adding a lot of

516
0:20:34,720 --> 0:20:37,360
spaces here

517
0:20:37,360 --> 0:20:40,240
we can start to see that i am kind of

518
0:20:40,240 --> 0:20:42,960
reducing i'm essentially thresholding

519
0:20:42,960 --> 0:20:45,280
the image in a way so that only the

520
0:20:45,280 --> 0:20:46,880
brightest pixels

521
0:20:46,880 --> 0:20:49,120
get uh kind of going with a particular

522
0:20:49,120 --> 0:20:51,840
character i can also just use different

523
0:20:51,840 --> 0:20:54,159
character strings

524
0:20:54,159 --> 0:20:55,919
for example here's another one although

525
0:20:55,919 --> 0:20:57,919
i have it inverted so if i have the

526
0:20:57,919 --> 0:20:59,440
darker characters at the beginning of

527
0:20:59,440 --> 0:21:01,280
the string and the brighter characters

528
0:21:01,280 --> 0:21:02,559
at the end

529
0:21:02,559 --> 0:21:05,440
i will want to change update my mapping

530
0:21:05,440 --> 0:21:07,440
to go from zero

531
0:21:07,440 --> 0:21:08,960
to length

532
0:21:08,960 --> 0:21:10,400
we can also play around with the

533
0:21:10,400 --> 0:21:12,400
resolution of the image i don't need to

534
0:21:12,400 --> 0:21:14,840
squash it into a square i don't

535
0:21:14,840 --> 0:21:18,400
think so now if it's 64 by 48 and i've

536
0:21:18,400 --> 0:21:20,240
adjusted the spacing of the characters

537
0:21:20,240 --> 0:21:22,080
and the line height i've done a pretty

538
0:21:22,080 --> 0:21:25,520
good job of having the image retain its

539
0:21:25,520 --> 0:21:28,240
original aspect ratio and dimensions i'm

540
0:21:28,240 --> 0:21:29,679
recording this during a live twitch

541
0:21:29,679 --> 0:21:31,280
stream so by the way you can go

542
0:21:31,280 --> 0:21:32,559
subscribe on twitch i don't know how

543
0:21:32,559 --> 0:21:34,080
much i'll be streaming on twitch versus

544
0:21:34,080 --> 0:21:35,520
youtube but i might as well put this in

545
0:21:35,520 --> 0:21:37,360
the video right now and in the chat i

546
0:21:37,360 --> 0:21:39,120
just got a suggestion why don't you

547
0:21:39,120 --> 0:21:40,640
filter out green since that's what a

548
0:21:40,640 --> 0:21:43,120
green screen is for so yes if i want to

549
0:21:43,120 --> 0:21:45,200
make use of the color values of the

550
0:21:45,200 --> 0:21:47,280
pixels there's a lot more that i could

551
0:21:47,280 --> 0:21:49,600
try i just i could keep going i don't

552
0:21:49,600 --> 0:21:51,840
want to keep going i want to stop here i

553
0:21:51,840 --> 0:21
want you to explore this and i want to

554
0:21 --> 0:21:56,159
create i want to see what kind of ascii

555
0:21:56,159 --> 0:21:58,159
art you create from this video please

556
0:21:58,159 --> 0:21:59,679
share it with me on the coding train

557
0:21:59,679 --> 0:22:02,240
website on social media all the links

558
0:22:02,240 --> 0:22:03,200
and various things are in the

559
0:22:03,200 --> 0:22:05,600
description thanks for tuning in i hope

560
0:22:05,600 --> 0:22
you enjoyed this coding challenge ah the

561
0:22 --> 0:22:10,159
boiler just came on there's a loud

562
0:22:10,159 --> 0:22:12,640
buzzing sound i'm leaving it in we're

563
0:22:12,640 --> 0:22:15,360
leaving it in this is in i'm in a

564
0:22:15,360 --> 0:22:18,159
freezing cold garage right now i had the

565
0:22:18,159 --> 0:22:20,400
heat off during this whole time just so

566
0:22:20,400 --> 0:22:21,440
i've been recording this coating

567
0:22:21,440 --> 0:22:23,039
challenge with you the heat just came

568
0:22:23,039 --> 0:22:25,039
back on i'm gonna go warm up inside with

569
0:22:25,039 --> 0:22:27,039
a toasty mug of something and i'll see

570
0:22:27,039 --> 0:22:30,860
you next time on the coding train

571
0:22:30,860 --> 0:22:41,039
[Music]

572
0:22:41,039 --> 0:22:43,120
you
