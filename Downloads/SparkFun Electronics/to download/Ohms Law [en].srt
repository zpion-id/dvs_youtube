1
0:00:03,980 --> 0:00:06,509
one of the most useful ways to analyze a

2
0:00:06,509 --> 0:00:08,429
circuit is to look at the relationship

3
0:00:08,429 --> 0:00:10,769
between voltage and current and there is

4
0:00:10,769 --> 0:00:12,480
one component that makes that analysis

5
0:00:12,480 --> 0:00:15,210
very simple this is the resistor its

6
0:00:15,210 --> 0:00:17,520
function is very simple it restricts the

7
0:00:17,520 --> 0:00:19,800
flow of electrons now impeding current

8
0:00:19,800 --> 0:00:21,869
may seem a little silly but there are

9
0:00:21,869 --> 0:00:23,910
times you may want to reduce the current

10
0:00:23,910 --> 0:00:25,800
flowing to a component or lower the

11
0:00:25,800 --> 0:00:27,119
voltage going to some sensitive

12
0:00:27,119 --> 0:00:29,369
electronics in an ideal world the

13
0:00:29,369 --> 0:00:31,230
resistor creates a linear relationship

14
0:00:31,230 --> 0:00:33,809
between current and voltage and if you

15
0:00:33,809 --> 0:00:35,730
know two of those three things voltage

16
0:00:35,730 --> 0:00:37,710
current and resistance you can easily

17
0:00:37,710 --> 0:00:39,780
calculate the third we'll see how to do

18
0:00:39,780 --> 0:00:40,290
that later

19
0:00:40,290 --> 0:00:42,329
but for now let's see how a resistor

20
0:00:42,329 --> 0:00:44,579
works in a circuit in the previous

21
0:00:44,579 --> 0:00:46,710
episode I showed how moving current can

22
0:00:46,710 --> 0:00:48,539
be represented by steel balls in a tube

23
0:00:48,539 --> 0:00
if one steel ball represented one

24
0:00 --> 0:00:53,579
electron then it would take around six

25
0:00:53,579 --> 0:00:55,920
point two five times 10 to the 18 steel

26
0:00:55,920 --> 0:00:58,829
balls to move past a point per second to

27
0:00:58,829 --> 0:01:00,989
make one amp since I don't have billions

28
0:01:00,989 --> 0:01:03,539
of steel balls in a massive plastic tube

29
0:01:03,539 --> 0:01:05,909
we need some other way to show electric

30
0:01:05,909 --> 0:01:08,369
current as it turns out fluids like air

31
0:01:08,369 --> 0:01:10,409
and water actually make a pretty good

32
0:01:10,409 --> 0:01:12,780
representation for electric current what

33
0:01:12,780 --> 0:01:15,150
I've got here is a circuit not of

34
0:01:15,150 --> 0:01:17,549
electricity but of water I've added some

35
0:01:17,549 --> 0:01:19,650
mica powder and blue food coloring to it

36
0:01:19,650 --> 0:01:21,030
so you can see the water flowing more

37
0:01:21,030 --> 0:01:23,280
easily in our little demo the pump

38
0:01:23,280 --> 0:01:25,409
represents a power supply like a battery

39
0:01:25,409 --> 0:01:27,420
or a wall adapter that pulls water up

40
0:01:27,420 --> 0:01:29,460
from well and gives it the push needed

41
0:01:29,460 --> 0:01:31,590
to move around the circuit the tubes are

42
0:01:31,590 --> 0:01:33,659
like wires they provide a path for the

43
0:01:33,659 --> 0:01:35,490
current the water pressure in the tubes

44
0:01:35,490 --> 0:01:37,799
corresponds to voltage and the amount of

45
0:01:37,799 --> 0:01:39,720
water moving through a tube corresponds

46
0:01:39,720 --> 0:01:41,909
to electrical current note that we're

47
0:01:41,909 --> 0:01:43,979
using conventional current so the water

48
0:01:43,979 --> 0:01:45,390
is flowing from high pressure to low

49
0:01:45,390 --> 0:01:48,270
pressure amperes is coulombs per second

50
0:01:48,270 --> 0:01:49,920
so in terms of water that would be

51
0:01:49,920 --> 0:01:51,630
volumetric flow rate something like

52
0:01:51,630 --> 0:01:54,119
cubic centimeters per second what we've

53
0:01:54,119 --> 0:01:56,009
got here is the water analogy of a

54
0:01:56,009 --> 0:01:58,170
resistor this is some steel wool shoved

55
0:01:58,170 --> 0:02:00,119
into a tube you can see how all that

56
0:02:00,119 --> 0:02:02,130
material resists the flow of water and

57
0:02:02,130 --> 0:02:04,110
there is higher pressure on the side the

58
0:02:04,110 --> 0:02:06,240
water is entering the resistor the same

59
0:02:06,240 --> 0:02:08,099
holds true in electronics there is a

60
0:02:08,099 --> 0:02:09,869
voltage difference between the ends of

61
0:02:09,869 --> 0:02:11,220
the resistor when current is flowing

62
0:02:11,220 --> 0:02:13,020
through it and this is known as a

63
0:02:13,020 --> 0:02:14,170
voltage drop

64
0:02:14,170 --> 0:02:16,210
let's go back to the actual resistor

65
0:02:16,210 --> 0:02:18,310
component if you were to slice one open

66
0:02:18,310 --> 0:02:20,020
you would find coils or film of tiny

67
0:02:20,020 --> 0:02:22,270
wire or a solid core made of a carbon

68
0:02:22,270 --> 0:02:22,959
mixture

69
0:02:22,959 --> 0:02:25,300
however it's made the resistor acts to

70
0:02:25,300 --> 0:02:28,480
impede current in 1825 the german

71
0:02:28,480 --> 0:02:30,610
physicist and mathematician Georg ohm

72
0:02:30,610 --> 0:02:32,890
began experimenting with early chemical

73
0:02:32,890 --> 0:02:34,630
batteries and thermocouples to produce

74
0:02:34,630 --> 0:02:37,360
voltages by varying the size of wires

75
0:02:37,360 --> 0:02:39,130
used to complete the circuit he

76
0:02:39,130 --> 0:02:40,900
determined that voltage and current were

77
0:02:40,900 --> 0:02:43,630
proportional in math terms that means

78
0:02:43,630 --> 0:02:45,880
the voltage between two points is equal

79
0:02:45,880 --> 0:02:47,290
to the current flowing between those

80
0:02:47,290 --> 0:02:49,780
points times some number and that number

81
0:02:49,780 --> 0:02:51,400
is known as the resistance between those

82
0:02:51,400 --> 0:02:54,489
points Ohm's law is often written as V

83
0:02:54,489 --> 0:02:57,250
equals IR or voltage is equal to current

84
0:02:57,250 --> 0:03:00,519
times resistance lucky for mr. ohm the

85
0:03:00,519 --> 0:03:02,410
unit for resistance was named after him

86
0:03:02,410 --> 0:03:04,420
the ohm is abbreviated with the Greek

87
0:03:04,420 --> 0:03:06,640
letter Omega with this information we

88
0:03:06,640 --> 0:03:08,860
can begin to analyze circuits as an

89
0:03:08,860 --> 0:03:10,630
example we'll connect a resistor to a

90
0:03:10,630 --> 0:03:13,450
power supply that provides 3 volts the

91
0:03:13,450 --> 0:03:15,130
electronic symbol for a resistor is a

92
0:03:15,130 --> 0:03:17,800
zigzag with two terminals it represents

93
0:03:17,800 --> 0:03:19,900
a more complicated path and therefore

94
0:03:19,900 --> 0:03:21,940
reduced current flow note that it

95
0:03:21,940 --> 0:03:23,530
doesn't matter which way we connect the

96
0:03:23,530 --> 0:03:25,239
resistor it will do its thing regardless

97
0:03:25,239 --> 0:03:27,340
of orientation we will connect the

98
0:03:27,340 --> 0:03:28,600
terminals of the resistor to the

99
0:03:28,600 --> 0:03:30,310
positive and negative terminals of a

100
0:03:30,310 --> 0:03:32,650
power supply that's been set to act as a

101
0:03:32,650 --> 0:03:35,019
voltage source a voltage source similar

102
0:03:35,019 --> 0:03:37,450
to a battery will supply as much current

103
0:03:37,450 --> 0:03:38,829
as needed to maintain a particular

104
0:03:38,829 --> 0:03:41,380
voltage between the terminals now that

105
0:03:41,380 --> 0:03:43,329
we have a circuit current will flow from

106
0:03:43,329 --> 0:03:44,590
the positive terminal of the voltage

107
0:03:44,590 --> 0:03:47,170
source through the resistor and back to

108
0:03:47,170 --> 0:03:49,060
the negative terminal the power supply

109
0:03:49,060 --> 0:03:51,070
will be set to 3 volts and it will also

110
0:03:51,070 --> 0:03:52,959
tell us how much current it is supplying

111
0:03:52,959 --> 0:03:55,180
with that information we can determine

112
0:03:55,180 --> 0:03:57,549
the resistance of the resistor let's try

113
0:03:57,549 --> 0:03:58,840
it all right

114
0:03:58,840 --> 0:04:00,370
I've connected the resistor to this

115
0:04:00,370 --> 0:04:02,290
power supply using some alligator clip

116
0:04:02,290 --> 0:04:04,239
leads you'll notice I used red for

117
0:04:04,239 --> 0:04:05,799
positive and black for negative

118
0:04:05,799 --> 0:04:07,269
terminals connected to the power supply

119
0:04:07,269 --> 0:04:11,920
when I turn it on it reads about 3.0 3

120
0:04:11,920 --> 0:04:14,200
volts and it also tells me that about

121
0:04:14,200 --> 0:04:17,109
point zero 3 amps are flowing from the

122
0:04:17,109 --> 0:04:18,970
positive terminal through the resistor

123
0:04:18,970 --> 0:04:21,400
and back to the negative terminal let's

124
0:04:21,400 --> 0:04:23,410
see if we can use this to calculate the

125
0:04:23,410 --> 0:04:25,840
resistance of this component using Ohm's

126
0:04:25,840 --> 0:04:27,070
law the

127
0:04:27,070 --> 0:04:29,380
I times are we can plug in the values

128
0:04:29,380 --> 0:04:31,930
from our readings so 3 volts equals

129
0:04:31,930 --> 0:04:34,990
point 0 3 amps times are using a little

130
0:04:34,990 --> 0:04:37,750
bit of algebra we can calculate R and we

131
0:04:37,750 --> 0:04:40,030
get R equals 101 owns

132
0:04:40,030 --> 0:04:41,950
now that we've mathematically determined

133
0:04:41,950 --> 0:04:44,380
that we have a 100 1 ohm resistor let's

134
0:04:44,380 --> 0:04:46,420
check our work this is a digital

135
0:04:46,420 --> 0:04:48,040
multimeter and it's one of your best

136
0:04:48,040 --> 0:04:50,410
friends when analyzing a circuit most

137
0:04:50,410 --> 0:04:52,330
basic models can do things like measure

138
0:04:52,330 --> 0:04:55,570
voltage current and resistance we'll set

139
0:04:55,570 --> 0:04:57,580
this one to measure resistance and touch

140
0:04:57,580 --> 0:04:59,260
the leads to the ends of the resistor as

141
0:04:59,260 --> 0:05:02,440
you can see it's reading about 100 point

142
0:05:02,440 --> 0:05:04,420
two ohms which is pretty close to our

143
0:05:04,420 --> 0:05:06,700
math results since this is labeled as a

144
0:05:06,700 --> 0:05:08,500
100 ohm resistor we'll call it good

145
0:05:08,500 --> 0:05:10,630
enough if you're wondering why the

146
0:05:10,630 --> 0:05:12,310
measurements and calculations didn't

147
0:05:12,310 --> 0:05:14,350
come out to be exactly 100 ohms that's

148
0:05:14,350 --> 0:05
because there are inconsistencies in the

149
0:05 --> 0:05:18,190
manufacturing of resistors which of

150
0:05:18,190 --> 0:05:19,960
course means that the resistance can be

151
0:05:19,960 --> 0:05:22,140
a little bit off from the listed value

152
0:05:22,140 --> 0:05:24,700
additionally there's resistance in the

153
0:05:24,700 --> 0:05:26,320
wires and potentially the power supply

154
0:05:26,320 --> 0:05:28,300
itself so measuring the voltage between

155
0:05:28,300 --> 0:05:30,070
the terminals of the power supply could

156
0:05:30,070 --> 0:05:31,540
be a little bit different than measuring

157
0:05:31,540 --> 0:05:33,250
the voltage between the terminals of the

158
0:05:33,250 --> 0:05:36,400
resistor back to our water demo we see

159
0:05:36,400 --> 0:05:38,200
that the steel wool much like the

160
0:05:38,200 --> 0:05:40,600
resistor restricts flow if we were to

161
0:05:40,600 --> 0:05:42,400
add an even denser material like a

162
0:05:42,400 --> 0:05:44,380
sponge the water flow would decrease

163
0:05:44,380 --> 0:05:46,300
even further the same holds true in

164
0:05:46,300 --> 0:05:48,430
electronics for a given voltage as

165
0:05:48,430 --> 0:05:52,170
resistance increases current decreases

166
0:05:52,170 --> 0:05:54,970
knowing Ohm's law by heart V equals IR

167
0:05:54,970 --> 0:05:56,620
will get you through many troubles in

168
0:05:56,620 --> 0:05:58,510
the electrical world so it's one of the

169
0:05:58,510 --> 0:06:00,130
few equations I recommend committing to

170
0:06:00,130 --> 0:06:03,460
memory besides it's only 3 letters as it

171
0:06:03,460 --> 0:06:05,200
turns out by resisting current

172
0:06:05,200 --> 0:06
electrical energy gets converted to heat

173
0:06 --> 0:06:09,430
in the next episode we'll learn how to

174
0:06:09,430 --> 0:06:11,980
calculate electrical power and figure

175
0:06:11,980 --> 0:06:13,480
out how to do something useful with all

176
0:06:13,480 --> 0:06:16,560
of that heat from resistors
