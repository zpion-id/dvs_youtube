1
0:00:03,920 --> 0:00:06,629
to understand how electricity works we

2
0:00:06,629 --> 0:00:09,030
need to zoom in on atoms the things that

3
0:00:09,030 --> 0:00:11,160
make up all matter atoms are made up of

4
0:00:11,160 --> 0:00:13,920
three basic particles that is protons

5
0:00:13,920 --> 0:00:15,890
which have a positive electric charge

6
0:00:15,890 --> 0:00:18,539
neutrons which have no electric charge

7
0:00:18,539 --> 0:00:21,390
and electrons which have a negative

8
0:00:21,390 --> 0:00
electric charge the protons and neutrons

9
0:00 --> 0:00:26,160
are tightly packed in the core or

10
0:00:26,160 --> 0:00:28,650
nucleus of an atom while electrons move

11
0:00:28,650 --> 0:00:30,539
about this nucleus in regions known as

12
0:00:30,539 --> 0:00:33,390
shells or orbitals right now this atom

13
0:00:33,390 --> 0:00:35,130
is electrically neutral as it has the

14
0:00:35,130 --> 0:00:36,750
same number of protons and electrons

15
0:00:36,750 --> 0:00:39,239
with enough energy an electron may be

16
0:00:39,239 --> 0:00:41,100
stripped away leaving the atom with a

17
0:00:41,100 --> 0:00:44,910
net positive charge likewise another

18
0:00:44,910 --> 0:00:47,250
atom may receive a free electron which

19
0:00:47,250 --> 0:00:48,719
then makes the atom electrically

20
0:00:48,719 --> 0:00:51,480
negative when we have two objects with

21
0:00:51,480 --> 0:00:53,129
different electric charges due to the

22
0:00:53,129 --> 0:00:55,199
absence or presence of excess electrons

23
0:00:55,199 --> 0:00:57,030
we say that we have static electricity

24
0:00:57,030 --> 0:00:59,879
we can demonstrate this using a balloon

25
0:00:59,879 --> 0:01:02,760
and a soda can when I rub a piece of

26
0:01:02,760 --> 0:01:04,890
cloth against the balloon I strip away

27
0:01:04,890 --> 0:01:07,020
electrons from the piece of cloth and

28
0:01:07,020 --> 0:01:09,119
add them to the balloon as a result this

29
0:01:09,119 --> 0:01:11,360
balloon now has a net negative charge

30
0:01:11,360 --> 0:01:14,010
when we bring it close to the can the

31
0:01:14,010 --> 0:01:17,520
can chases the balloon let's look at why

32
0:01:17,520 --> 0:01:19,950
that's happening the aluminum in the can

33
0:01:19,950 --> 0:01:21,750
is a conductor which means that the

34
0:01:21,750 --> 0:01:23,520
electrons can freely move about the

35
0:01:23,520 --> 0:01:25,830
material as we bring the negatively

36
0:01:25,830 --> 0:01:27,990
charged balloon near the metal the

37
0:01:27,990 --> 0:01:29,729
electrons are pushed away to the far

38
0:01:29,729 --> 0:01:31,890
side of the can since like charges repel

39
0:01:31,890 --> 0:01:34,590
that leaves an excess of positive charge

40
0:01:34,590 --> 0:01:36,119
on the side of the can nearest the

41
0:01:36,119 --> 0:01:37,979
balloon which is pulled toward the

42
0:01:37,979 --> 0:01:39,840
balloon as opposite charges attract

43
0:01:39,840 --> 0:01:42,299
since the positive charges are closer to

44
0:01:42,299 --> 0:01:43,680
the balloon than the negative charges

45
0:01:43,680 --> 0:01:45,840
the attractive force is greater than the

46
0:01:45,840 --> 0:01:48,360
repulsive force this results in a net

47
0:01:48,360 --> 0:01:50,220
force that pulls the can toward the

48
0:01:50,220 --> 0:01:52,079
balloon let's see that again in instant

49
0:01:52,079 --> 0:01:56,670
replay before we go any further let's

50
0:01:56,670 --> 0:01:58,860
talk about units the SI unit for

51
0:01:58,860 --> 0:02:01,229
electric charge is the Coulomb generally

52
0:02:01,229 --> 0:02
abbreviated with an uppercase C an

53
0:02 --> 0:02:05,460
electron has a charge of about negative

54
0:02:05,460 --> 0:02:07,860
one point 602 times 10 to the negative

55
0:02:07,860 --> 0:02:11,400
19 coulombs and a proton has a charge of

56
0:02:11,400 --> 0:02:13,770
about positive 1.60 to tie

57
0:02:13,770 --> 0:02:16,770
10 to the negative 19 coulombs energy is

58
0:02:16,770 --> 0:02:18,420
usually given in joules which is

59
0:02:18,420 --> 0:02:20,580
abbreviated with the symbol uppercase J

60
0:02:20,580 --> 0:02:22,920
1 joule is equal to the amount of energy

61
0:02:22,920 --> 0:02:25,380
transferred to an object when a force of

62
0:02:25,380 --> 0:02:27,480
one Newton is applied to that object

63
0:02:27,480 --> 0:02:30,240
over a distance of 1 meter energy can

64
0:02:30,240 --> 0:02:32,220
either be potential which results from

65
0:02:32,220 --> 0:02:34,410
an object's position or arrangement or

66
0:02:34,410 --> 0:02:36,390
kinetic resulting from the object's

67
0:02:36,390 --> 0:02:39,030
motion both kinetic and potential energy

68
0:02:39,030 --> 0:02:40,920
are given in joules now we can define

69
0:02:40,920 --> 0:02:43,530
voltage voltage is a measure of electric

70
0:02:43,530 --> 0:02:46,500
potential between two points the unit

71
0:02:46,500 --> 0:02:48,330
volt is defined as one Joule of

72
0:02:48,330 --> 0:02:50,790
potential energy per unit charge given

73
0:02:50,790 --> 0:02:52,860
in coulombs let's explain this with an

74
0:02:52,860 --> 0:02:55,170
example let's say that I've got a

75
0:02:55,170 --> 0:02:57,300
particle with a negative 1 Coulomb of

76
0:02:57,300 --> 0:02:59,490
charge then let's say there is a

77
0:02:59,490 --> 0:03:01,380
particle with positive 1 Coulomb of

78
0:03:01,380 --> 0:03:03,480
charge next to it since opposites

79
0:03:03,480 --> 0:03:05,580
attract and the positive particle is as

80
0:03:05,580 --> 0:03:07,440
close as it can get to the negative

81
0:03:07,440 --> 0:03:09,690
particle everything is at rest there is

82
0:03:09,690 --> 0:03:13,110
no kinetic or potential energy now let's

83
0:03:13,110 --> 0:03:15,300
say that I need to use 10 joules of

84
0:03:15,300 --> 0:03:17,640
energy to move the positive particle

85
0:03:17,640 --> 0:03:19,800
from its resting position to this point

86
0:03:19,800 --> 0:03:22,380
if I were to release it it would move

87
0:03:22,380 --> 0:03:24,660
back to the negative particle as a

88
0:03:24,660 --> 0:03:27,150
result we can say that it has 10 joules

89
0:03:27,150 --> 0:03:29,760
of electric potential energy so long as

90
0:03:29,760 --> 0:03:33,360
I hold it here now if I repeated this

91
0:03:33,360 --> 0:03:35,820
demo with 3 positively charged particles

92
0:03:35,820 --> 0:03:38,310
it would take 30 joules of energy to

93
0:03:38,310 --> 0:03:39,990
move them the same distance away from

94
0:03:39,990 --> 0:03:42,750
the negative particle so they have 30

95
0:03:42,750 --> 0:03:44,700
joules of potential energy as long as

96
0:03:44,700 --> 0:03:46,650
I'm holding them here as we defined

97
0:03:46,650 --> 0:03:48,540
earlier voltage is the electric

98
0:03:48,540 --> 0:03:50,910
potential between two points to

99
0:03:50,910 --> 0:03:52,500
calculate the voltage between their

100
0:03:52,500 --> 0:03:54,420
starting and ending points we know that

101
0:03:54,420 --> 0:03:56,250
I did 30 joules of work to move the

102
0:03:56,250 --> 0:03:58,530
particles and the total charges three

103
0:03:58,530 --> 0:04:01,290
coulombs so the voltage is 30 joules

104
0:04:01,290 --> 0:04:03,870
divided by 3 coulombs which is 10 volts

105
0:04:03,870 --> 0:04:06,060
we would say that the electric potential

106
0:04:06,060 --> 0:04:08,580
between these two points is 10 volts if

107
0:04:08,580 --> 0:04:11,010
I released one of the particles it would

108
0:04:11,010 --> 0:04:12,540
move back to the negatively charged

109
0:04:12,540 --> 0:04:14,610
particle that would leave me with 20

110
0:04:14,610 --> 0:04:16,530
joules of potential energy and 2

111
0:04:16,530 --> 0:04:18,810
coulombs of charge so the potential is

112
0:04:18,810 --> 0:04:21,930
still 10 volts even if I had no positive

113
0:04:21,930 --> 0:04:23,970
particles the potential between the two

114
0:04:23,970 --> 0:04:26,310
points is still 10 volts as you can see

115
0:04:26,310 --> 0:04:26,990
a

116
0:04:26,990 --> 0:04:29,060
your potential energy is not the same as

117
0:04:29,060 --> 0:04:31,430
electric potential when we start talking

118
0:04:31,430 --> 0:04:32,810
about moving electrons through

119
0:04:32,810 --> 0:04:34,789
conductors and electronic components we

120
0:04:34,789 --> 0:04:36,620
are talking about current electricity

121
0:04:36,620 --> 0:04:38,419
which is slightly different than static

122
0:04:38,419 --> 0:04:40,160
electricity let's take a look at a

123
0:04:40,160 --> 0:04:42,380
battery it doesn't really matter how far

124
0:04:42,380 --> 0:04:44,120
apart the terminals of a battery are the

125
0:04:44,120 --> 0:04:46,009
chemicals inside a battery determine the

126
0:04:46,009 --> 0:04:47,449
electrical potential between the

127
0:04:47,449 --> 0:04:49,669
terminals a fully charged double a

128
0:04:49,669 --> 0:04:52,430
alkaline battery is listed as having 1.5

129
0:04:52,430 --> 0:04:54,650
volts that means each Coulomb of charge

130
0:04:54,650 --> 0:04:56,810
moving from one end of the battery will

131
0:04:56,810 --> 0:05:00,080
do 1.5 joules of work now compare that

132
0:05:00,080 --> 0:05:02,479
to a much larger d-cell battery each

133
0:05:02,479 --> 0:05:05,419
Coulomb of charge will still only do 1.5

134
0:05:05,419 --> 0:05:08,210
joules of work but a D cell has far more

135
0:05:08,210 --> 0:05:10,490
coulombs of charge than a double a as a

136
0:05:10,490 --> 0:05:12,770
result these cells will last a lot

137
0:05:12,770 --> 0:05:14,750
longer than double A batteries doing the

138
0:05:14,750 --> 0:05:17,360
same amount of work static electricity

139
0:05:17,360 --> 0:05:19,520
can be a lot of fun but more often than

140
0:05:19,520 --> 0:05:21,259
not it's considered dangerous or a

141
0:05:21,259 --> 0:05:22,849
nuisance one of the most dramatic

142
0:05:22,849 --> 0:05:25,039
displays of static electricity happens

143
0:05:25,039 --> 0:05:27,470
in nature storm clouds can build up a

144
0:05:27,470 --> 0:05:29,210
potential difference of millions of

145
0:05:29,210 --> 0:05:31,520
volts when compared to the earth and at

146
0:05:31,520 --> 0:05:34,250
some point the electrons actually forced

147
0:05:34,250 --> 0:05:36,080
their way through the air creating

148
0:05:36,080 --> 0:05:37,970
lightning in order to balance out that

149
0:05:37,970 --> 0:05:40,520
charge difference this sudden flow of

150
0:05:40,520 --> 0:05:42,650
electricity an attempt to neutralize two

151
0:05:42,650 --> 0:05:44,539
statically charged objects is known as

152
0:05:44,539 --> 0:05:47,509
electrostatic discharge or ESD while

153
0:05:47,509 --> 0:05:49,610
lightning is a rather extreme display of

154
0:05:49,610 --> 0:05:51,259
electrostatic build-up and discharge

155
0:05:51,259 --> 0:05:53,479
static electricity can still be quite

156
0:05:53,479 --> 0:05:56,210
useful for example many factory and

157
0:05:56,210 --> 0:05:57,949
power plant smokestacks employ a

158
0:05:57,949 --> 0:06:00,349
technology that use a static electricity

159
0:06:00,349 --> 0:06:02,900
to pull soot and ash out of the air as

160
0:06:02,900 --> 0:06:05,210
it flows up through the pipe resulting

161
0:06:05,210 --> 0:06:08,240
in less pollution also most cars are

162
0:06:08,240 --> 0:06:10,009
painted using a process called powder

163
0:06:10,009 --> 0:06:12,349
coating in this paint leaving the spray

164
0:06:12,349 --> 0:06:14,300
nozzle is given an electric charge and

165
0:06:14,300 --> 0:06:16,039
the car body is given a different

166
0:06:16,039 --> 0:06:18,620
electric charge which creates a stronger

167
0:06:18,620 --> 0:06:20,330
bond between the paint and the car body

168
0:06:20,330 --> 0:06:22,820
this allows for a more uniform paint

169
0:06:22,820 --> 0:06:25,400
coverage and reduces paint waste since

170
0:06:25,400 --> 0:06:27,229
less of its likely to stick around in

171
0:06:27,229 --> 0:06:30,289
the air or drip off the car body next

172
0:06:30,289 --> 0:06:31,940
time we'll dive into current electricity

173
0:06:31,940 --> 0:06:36,159
and talk about making it do work for us
