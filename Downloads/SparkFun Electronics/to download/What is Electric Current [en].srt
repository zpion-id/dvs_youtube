1
0:00:04,220 --> 0:00:06,750
previously we talked about how electric

2
0:00:06,750 --> 0:00:08,460
charges can build up on surfaces and

3
0:00:08,460 --> 0:00:10,019
create something known as static

4
0:00:10,019 --> 0:00:12,750
electricity in this episode let's talk

5
0:00:12,750 --> 0:00:14,250
about what happens when these electric

6
0:00:14,250 --> 0:00:16,440
charges continuously move in a process

7
0:00:16,440 --> 0:00:18,869
known as current electricity most

8
0:00:18,869 --> 0:00:20,369
electronics everything from your

9
0:00:20,369 --> 0:00:22,619
refrigerator to your smartphone requires

10
0:00:22,619 --> 0:00:25,230
current electricity to operate let's

11
0:00:25,230 --> 0:00:26,939
assume that we have a copper wire that's

12
0:00:26,939 --> 0:00:29,189
filled with copper atoms copper is one

13
0:00:29,189 --> 0:00:30,689
of those elements that has only one

14
0:00:30,689 --> 0:00:33,030
electron in its outermost shell which

15
0:00:33,030 --> 0:00:35,010
means that with only a little energy

16
0:00:35,010 --> 0:00:37,200
that electron can be easily ejected if

17
0:00:37,200 --> 0:00:39,510
we push a free electron into the copper

18
0:00:39,510 --> 0:00:41,610
wire it will eventually find a new atom

19
0:00:41,610 --> 0:00:43,800
to latch onto the negative charge of

20
0:00:43,800 --> 0:00:45,390
that electron will eject another

21
0:00:45,390 --> 0:00:47,850
electron from the outer shell which will

22
0:00:47,850 --> 0:00:49,980
then move on to the next atom and so on

23
0:00:49,980 --> 0:00:52,649
and so on this chain of moving electrons

24
0:00:52,649 --> 0:00:55,110
creates a flow known as electric current

25
0:00:55,110 --> 0:00:57,629
some elements like copper aluminum and

26
0:00:57,629 --> 0:00:59,879
gold can move electrons easily and are

27
0:00:59,879 --> 0:01:02,550
known as conductors we can look at

28
0:01:02,550 --> 0:01:05,070
moving charges in another way let's say

29
0:01:05,070 --> 0:01:06,960
that this tube is a conductive wire and

30
0:01:06,960 --> 0:01:08,729
the steel balls are negative electric

31
0:01:08,729 --> 0:01:11,070
charges electrons in this case we might

32
0:01:11,070 --> 0:01:13,470
think that one charged particle needs to

33
0:01:13,470 --> 0:01:15,330
move completely through the conductor to

34
0:01:15,330 --> 0:01:17,490
create a flow but that's not actually

35
0:01:17,490 --> 0:01:20,040
the case as we push a ball in one end

36
0:01:20,040 --> 0:01:22,320
the force causes all the balls to move

37
0:01:22,320 --> 0:01:24,659
and one pops out the other end as you

38
0:01:24,659 --> 0:01:27,150
can see one electron even if it doesn't

39
0:01:27,150 --> 0:01:29,189
move very far can force all the other

40
0:01:29,189 --> 0:01:31,950
electrons to move creating a flow what

41
0:01:31,950 --> 0:01:33,840
we just showed was electric current

42
0:01:33,840 --> 0:01:35,939
which is a flow of electric charge in

43
0:01:35,939 --> 0:01:38,070
most circuits this is accomplished by

44
0:01:38,070 --> 0:01:40,409
moving electrons the unit for measuring

45
0:01:40,409 --> 0:01:42,810
current is the ampere which is often

46
0:01:42,810 --> 0:01:44,640
abbreviated as amps and written with a

47
0:01:44,640 --> 0:01:47,790
capital A one ampere is defined as one

48
0:01:47,790 --> 0:01:49,920
Coulomb of charge moving past a point

49
0:01:49,920 --> 0:01:52,619
per second let's look at a cross-section

50
0:01:52,619 --> 0:01:54,990
of wire carrying an electric current if

51
0:01:54,990 --> 0:01:58,020
it takes three seconds for 6 coulombs of

52
0:01:58,020 --> 0:01:59,130
charge to move through that

53
0:01:59,130 --> 0:02:01,799
cross-section then we say that two amps

54
0:02:01,799 --> 0:02:03,079
are moving through that wire

55
0:02:03,079 --> 0:02:05,490
unfortunately electric current doesn't

56
0:02:05,490 --> 0:02:07,590
just magically flow through wires it

57
0:02:07,590 --> 0:02:10,890
needs a little help if left alone the

58
0:02:10,890 --> 0:02:12,740
electrons in a wire won't move

59
0:02:12,740 --> 0:02:14,810
we need to give them a little push to do

60
0:02:14,810 --> 0:02:16,790
that we'll use a voltage source like a

61
0:02:16,790 --> 0:02:18,920
battery in a battery there is a buildup

62
0:02:18,920 --> 0:02:20,900
of negative charge on one side in the

63
0:02:20,900 --> 0:02:23,300
form of excess electrons the other side

64
0:02:23,300 --> 0:02:25,190
has a buildup of positive charge in

65
0:02:25,190 --> 0:02:27,710
absence of electrons in this case the

66
0:02:27,710 --> 0:02:30,050
charges want to balance out but the only

67
0:02:30,050 --> 0:02:31,880
way to do that is for the excess

68
0:02:31,880 --> 0:02:33,560
electrons to flow around the battery

69
0:02:33,560 --> 0:02:36,260
through a conductor that we provide if

70
0:02:36,260 --> 0:02:37,820
we connect a piece of wire to the

71
0:02:37,820 --> 0:02:39,740
negative terminal the electrons will

72
0:02:39,740 --> 0:02:41,810
push against the electrons in the wire

73
0:02:41,810 --> 0:02:44,390
however air is an insulator as its

74
0:02:44,390 --> 0:02:45,920
molecules do not have very mobile

75
0:02:45,920 --> 0:02:48,050
electrons and it won't readily accept

76
0:02:48,050 --> 0:02:49,940
the free electrons to show this we'll

77
0:02:49,940 --> 0:02:51,500
put a piece of tape at the end of the

78
0:02:51,500 --> 0:02:53,900
tube now the electrons at the end of the

79
0:02:53,900 --> 0:02:54,950
wire have nowhere to go

80
0:02:54,950 --> 0:02:57,380
even if we push against the electrons in

81
0:02:57,380 --> 0:02:59,450
the wire they still won't budge to fix

82
0:02:59,450 --> 0:03:01,460
this we need to connect the other end of

83
0:03:01,460 --> 0:03:03,140
the wire to a place where the electrons

84
0:03:03,140 --> 0:03:05,240
want to go and the positive end of the

85
0:03:05,240 --> 0:03:06,560
battery will happily accept the

86
0:03:06,560 --> 0:03:09,080
electrons in fact don't try this with a

87
0:03:09,080 --> 0:03:10,880
real battery there is nothing slowing

88
0:03:10,880 --> 0:03:11,900
down or restricting the flow of

89
0:03:11,900 --> 0:03:13,910
electrons which results in tremendous

90
0:03:13,910 --> 0:03:15,860
amounts of energy being transformed into

91
0:03:15,860 --> 0:03:17,960
heat in the wire and this could easily

92
0:03:17,960 --> 0:03:20,110
melt the wire insulation or start a fire

93
0:03:20,110 --> 0:03:23,150
this is known as a closed circuit as it

94
0:03:23,150 --> 0:03:24,980
creates a loop from one side of the

95
0:03:24,980 --> 0:03:27,320
energy source to the other if we break

96
0:03:27,320 --> 0:03:29,120
the wire or remove it from one of the

97
0:03:29,120 --> 0:03:30,980
terminals then the electrons will stop

98
0:03:30,980 --> 0:03:33,340
flowing this is known as an open circuit

99
0:03:33,340 --> 0:03:35,810
we've been talking about electron flow

100
0:03:35,810 --> 0:03:37,760
in a circuit and showing how electrons

101
0:03:37,760 --> 0:03:39,590
move from the negative terminal to the

102
0:03:39,590 --> 0:03:42,830
positive terminal however in electronics

103
0:03:42,830 --> 0:03:44,780
we usually assign current as flowing

104
0:03:44,780 --> 0:03:47,480
from positive to negative or from higher

105
0:03:47,480 --> 0:03:49,760
potential to lower potential this is

106
0:03:49,760 --> 0:03:52,430
known as conventional current in the

107
0:03:52,430 --> 0:03:55,100
mid-1700s Benjamin Franklin theorized

108
0:03:55,100 --> 0:03:57,320
that positively charged objects had an

109
0:03:57,320 --> 0:03:59,300
excess of what he called electric fluid

110
0:03:59,300 --> 0:04:01,910
and that negatively charged objects had

111
0:04:01,910 --> 0:04:04,550
a deficit of this fluid Franklin noted

112
0:04:04,550 --> 0:04:06,800
that this fluid had a tendency to flow

113
0:04:06,800 --> 0:04:08,960
from positive to negative to distribute

114
0:04:08,960 --> 0:04:11,330
itself more evenly it wasn't until the

115
0:04:11,330 --> 0:04:13,250
end of the 19th century that English

116
0:04:13,250 --> 0:04:15,530
physicist JJ Thompson discovered the

117
0:04:15,530 --> 0:04:17,930
existence of the electron even though we

118
0:04:17,930 --> 0:04:19,940
now know that it is electrons that move

119
0:04:19,940 --> 0:04:21,799
inside of most circuits from low to high

120
0:04:21,799 --> 0:04:24,050
potential the convention of current

121
0:04:24,050 --> 0:04:26,060
moving from high to low potential stop

122
0:04:26,060 --> 0:04:28,190
as a result most current measurements

123
0:04:28,190 --> 0:04:29,960
are given as conventional current which

124
0:04:29,960 --> 0:04:32,150
is the movement of positive charge in a

125
0:04:32,150 --> 0:04:33,800
circuit and is represented by the

126
0:04:33,800 --> 0:04:36,080
capital letter I don't worry the math

127
0:04:36,080 --> 0:04:37,880
still works out as long as we stick with

128
0:04:37,880 --> 0:04:40,040
either electron flow or conventional

129
0:04:40,040 --> 0:04:42,050
current and since most electronics

130
0:04:42,050 --> 0:04:43,910
textbooks use conventional current we'll

131
0:04:43,910 --> 0:04:46,040
go with that we talked about making

132
0:04:46,040 --> 0:04:48,410
electricity do work for us and the

133
0:04:48,410 --> 0:04:50,389
circuit forms the basis for all modern

134
0:04:50,389 --> 0:04:52,340
electronics everything from the simple

135
0:04:52,340 --> 0:04:54,500
flashlight to massive supercomputers if

136
0:04:54,500 --> 0:04:56,720
we made a circuit out of just a battery

137
0:04:56,720 --> 0:04:58,970
and a piece of wire there's a chance we

138
0:04:58,970 --> 0:05:00,770
might melt that wire as the electrons

139
0:05:00,770 --> 0:05:02,389
move through that wire at an alarming

140
0:05:02,389 --> 0:05:04,760
rate and generate massive amounts of

141
0:05:04,760 --> 0:05:06,979
heat in the next episode we'll talk

142
0:05:06,979 --> 0:05:08,540
about the relationship between voltage

143
0:05:08,540 --> 0:05:13,030
and current and introduce the resistor
