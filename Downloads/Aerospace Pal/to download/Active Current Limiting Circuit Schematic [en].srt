00:00:00,000 --> 0:00:02,310
thanks for tuning in with aerospace pal

0:00:02,310 --> 0:00:04,350
as we discuss the pros and cons of

3
0:00:04,350 --> 0:00:06,810
current-limiting circuits when designing

4
0:00:06,810 --> 0:00:08,849
a power supply one must consider the

5
0:00:08,849 --> 0:00:10,260
holdup time during the power

6
0:00:10,260 --> 0:00:12,330
interruption and often times large

7
0:00:12,330 --> 0:00:14,219
capacitors are placed on the main power

8
0:00:14,219 --> 0:00:16,440
line to handle this goal because of

9
0:00:16,440 --> 0:00:18,300
interest requirements or tantalum

10
0:00:18,300 --> 0:00:20,490
component limitations it can be required

11
0:00:20,490 --> 0:00:22,650
to limit the current to that holdup

12
0:00:22,650 --> 0:00:24,960
circuitry many engineers use a simple

13
0:00:24,960 --> 0:00:27,300
current limiting resistor and diode to

14
0:00:27,300 --> 0:00:30,060
do this job and this works it's simple

15
0:00:30,060 --> 0:00:31,940
and effective for the power dropout

16
0:00:31,940 --> 0:00:34,200
however engineers miss a great

17
0:00:34,200 --> 0:00:36,450
opportunity that might hurt them when

18
0:00:36,450 --> 0:00:38,579
they go to do emissions testing at

19
0:00:38,579 --> 0:00:41,370
qualification high capacitance is

20
0:00:41,370 --> 0:00:43,620
effective at filtering out low-frequency

21
0:00:43,620 --> 0:00:45,329
noise and can be hard to do with any

22
0:00:45,329 --> 0:00:47,789
other component using the configuration

23
0:00:47,789 --> 0:00:50,219
shown the holdup cap of a thousand

24
0:00:50,219 --> 0:00:52,800
microfarads will be charged to the same

25
0:00:52,800 --> 0:00:55,649
level as the one microfarad caps however

26
0:00:55,649 --> 0:00:58,170
during a low frequency event it will be

27
0:00:58,170 --> 0:01:00,660
limited to the d1 forward voltage drop

28
0:01:00,660 --> 0:01:03,420
and as you can see if you do power

29
0:01:03,420 --> 0:01:04,949
interruption test it will

30
0:01:04,949 --> 0:01:07,619
instantaneously drop by the d1 forward

31
0:01:07,619 --> 0:01:10,080
voltage this transient can cause an

32
0:01:10,080 --> 0:01:12,330
emissions failure at qualification

33
0:01:12,330 --> 0:01:15,180
alternatively if use this four component

34
0:01:15,180 --> 0:01:17,700
circuit to actively limit the current to

35
0:01:17,700 --> 0:01:19,470
your holdup capacitor it'll put your

36
0:01:19,470 --> 0:01:21,450
holdup capacitor in line with your

37
0:01:21,450 --> 0:01:23,850
decoupling caps effectively filtering

38
0:01:23,850 --> 0:01:26,189
out low-frequency current demand noise

39
0:01:26,189 --> 0:01:28,590
using this circuit and it's dynamic

40
0:01:28,590 --> 0:01:30,600
resistance you can charge your holdup

41
0:01:30,600 --> 0:01:32,670
capacitance in the set amount of time

42
0:01:32,670 --> 0:01:35,070
you choose learn how to use this circuit

43
0:01:35,070 --> 0:01:37,530
