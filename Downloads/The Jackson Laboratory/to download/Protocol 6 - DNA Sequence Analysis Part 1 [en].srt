1
0:00:08,330 --> 0:00:11,460
before you begin download the sequence

2
0:00:11,460 --> 0:00:13,410
viewing software appropriate for your

3
0:00:13,410 --> 0:00:16,320
computing system in this example I am

4
0:00:16,320 --> 0:00:18,720
using a Mac so we have recommended using

5
0:00:18,720 --> 0:00:21,380
a Mac based program called for Peaks

6
0:00:21,380 --> 0:00:24,029
check the protocol for our suggestions

7
0:00:24,029 --> 0:00:27,810
for PC tablets and netbooks and consult

8
0:00:27,810 --> 0:00:30,480
your IT department for your institutions

9
0:00:30,480 --> 0:00:42,020
installation procedures

10
0:00:42,020 --> 0:00:44,480
next you need to download the sequence

11
0:00:44,480 --> 0:00:47,060
data we will distribute your class's

12
0:00:47,060 --> 0:00:54,860
data using the canvas platform navigate

13
0:00:54,860 --> 0:00:57,110
to the modules tab and scroll to the

14
0:00:57,110 --> 0:01:17,240
laboratory module within the module

15
0:01:17,240 --> 0:01:19,370
there will be a page called sequencing

16
0:01:19,370 --> 0:01:28,729
results download your class data by

17
0:01:28,729 --> 0:01:37,860
clicking on the link

18
0:01:37,860 --> 0:01:40,530
the data is downloaded as a compressed

19
0:01:40,530 --> 0:01:44,400
dot zip file the Mac automatically

20
0:01:44,400 --> 0:01:47,040
uncompressed is the file but PC users

21
0:01:47,040 --> 0:01:49,320
will need to right-click and uncompress

22
0:01:49,320 --> 0:01:51,440
the file in order to access the data

23
0:01:51,440 --> 0:01
keep in mind that the data is normally

24
0:01 --> 0:01:57,060
held in a Downloads folder unless you

25
0:01:57,060 --> 0:02:07,560
specifically save it elsewhere the data

26
0:02:07,560 --> 0:02:10,500
files have long complicated names but

27
0:02:10,500 --> 0:02:11,820
the designation you should pay attention

28
0:02:11,820 --> 0:02:16,110
to comes after the 10 digit barcode you

29
0:02:16,110 --> 0:02:18,420
can find your sample by finding the

30
0:02:18,420 --> 0:02:23,810
sample number or the sample name

31
0:02:23,810 --> 0:02:27,959
followed by the target gene and the

32
0:02:27,959 --> 0:02:32,160
direction of the read for this analysis

33
0:02:32,160 --> 0:02:35,010
we are specifically interested in a b1

34
0:02:35,010 --> 0:02:37,320
files which can be read by the

35
0:02:37,320 --> 0:02:40,860
downloaded sequencing software there are

36
0:02:40,860 --> 0:02:43,530
several ways to open the file you can

37
0:02:43,530 --> 0:02:45,540
double click it if it has been linked to

38
0:02:45,540 --> 0:02:52,349
the software

39
0:02:52,349 --> 0:03:05,370
open the file directly from the software

40
0:03:05,370 --> 0:03:08,769
or drag and drop the file into the

41
0:03:08,769 --> 0:03:40,290
software

42
0:03:40,290 --> 0:04:01,410
let's look at some data

43
0:04:01,410 --> 0:04:04,180
when you open the file there's a lot

44
0:04:04,180 --> 0:04:06,640
going on visually remember this data

45
0:04:06,640 --> 0:04:08,890
represents the detection of fragments

46
0:04:08,890 --> 0:04:10,870
differing by one base pair in size

47
0:04:10,870 --> 0:04:13,330
during the process of a PCR reaction

48
0:04:13,330 --> 0:04:16,840
that includes dye deoxynucleotides the

49
0:04:16,840 --> 0:04:18,940
line traces represent fluorescence

50
0:04:18,940 --> 0:04:20,549
levels of the tagged dye

51
0:04:20,549 --> 0:04:21,760
deoxynucleotides

52
0:04:21,760 --> 0:04:23,830
as they migrate through the sequencing

53
0:04:23,830 --> 0:04:26,560
machine the length of time that it takes

54
0:04:26,560 --> 0:04:28,600
to migrate through the capillary gel

55
0:04:28,600 --> 0:04:31,030
matrix corresponds with the length of

56
0:04:31,030 --> 0:04:37,180
the amplified fragment the gray bars

57
0:04:37,180 --> 0:04:39,580
behind the line traces represent the

58
0:04:39,580 --> 0:04:41,320
quality of the base call at that

59
0:04:41,320 --> 0:04:43,900
location these quality bars may be

60
0:04:43,900 --> 0:04:45,460
represented differently in other

61
0:04:45,460 --> 0:04:48,520
programs but most will have them if the

62
0:04:48,520 --> 0:04:50,590
call is of good quality the bar should

63
0:04:50,590 --> 0:04:53,830
fill the height of the window on the top

64
0:04:53,830 --> 0:04:56,110
of the window letters represent the base

65
0:04:56,110 --> 0:04:58,030
called by the software at each

66
0:04:58,030 --> 0:05:01,840
nucleotide location so what is good

67
0:05:01,840 --> 0:05:04,990
quality and what is poor quality good

68
0:05:04,990 --> 0:05:07,240
quality sequence reads have distinct

69
0:05:07,240 --> 0:05:10,560
steep and smooth single line peaks

70
0:05:10,560 --> 0:05:13,330
representing well separated fragments as

71
0:05:13,330 --> 0:05:15,220
they pass by the fluorescence detector

72
0:05:15,220 --> 0:05:18,520
in the sequencing machine if Peaks

73
0:05:18,520 --> 0:05:21,639
overlap are jagged or contain broad

74
0:05:21,639 --> 0:05:23,860
shoulders then the software base calls

75
0:05:23,860 --> 0:05:27,610
are no longer reliable in this example

76
0:05:27,610 --> 0:05:31,599
the entire file is of poor quality where

77
0:05:31,599 --> 0:05:36,130
you can see overlapping lines jagged

78
0:05:36,130 --> 0:05:39,689
lines and broad lines

79
0:05:39,689 --> 0:05:41,849
this could be due to contamination of

80
0:05:41,849 --> 0:05:44,969
the sample multiple PCR products or

81
0:05:44,969 --> 0:05:47,219
improper priming or process of the

82
0:05:47,219 --> 0:05:50,309
sequencing reaction either way this data

83
0:05:50,309 --> 0:06:15,779
is completely unusable upon opening

84
0:06:15,779 --> 0:06:18,059
another file we can see what good

85
0:06:18,059 --> 0:06:21,050
quality traces are supposed to look like

86
0:06:21,050 --> 0:06:25,319
distinct steep and smooth single line

87
0:06:25,319 --> 0:06:28,110
Peaks the base call at the top of the

88
0:06:28,110 --> 0:06:30,689
window should reflect the color of the

89
0:06:30,689 --> 0:06:34,679
trace below it however there is almost

90
0:06:34,679 --> 0:06:37,199
always poor quality sequence at the

91
0:06:37,199 --> 0:06:39,989
beginning and end of even good quality

92
0:06:39,989 --> 0:06:45,869
reads highlight and delete the area of

93
0:06:45,869 --> 0:06:59,539
low quality calls to be deleted

94
0:06:59,539 --> 0:07:02,430
this does not eliminate the raw trace

95
0:07:02,430 --> 0:07:04,979
data but simply removes the base calls

96
0:07:04,979 --> 0:07:29,300
by the software

97
0:07:29,300 --> 0:07:32,240
before moving on scan the sequence by

98
0:07:32,240 --> 0:07:34,160
eye to ensure that the software is

99
0:07:34,160 --> 0:07:57,710
making appropriate calls

100
0:07:57,710 --> 0:08:00,920
one thing to look out for is artifacts

101
0:08:00,920 --> 0:08:03,840
these aberrant traces will reduce call

102
0:08:03,840 --> 0:08:06,570
quality and may tempt you to trash the

103
0:08:06,570 --> 0:08:09,480
file however if you looked at several

104
0:08:09,480 --> 0:08:12,060
data files you would see that this trace

105
0:08:12,060 --> 0:08:15,330
exists in every single file indicating

106
0:08:15,330 --> 0:08:17,880
that it's not poor quality sample but an

107
0:08:17,880 --> 0:08:19,770
error in the technical process of

108
0:08:19,770 --> 0:08:23,100
sequencing what can be seen is that

109
0:08:23,100 --> 0:08:25,680
behind this shouldered artifact our

110
0:08:25,680 --> 0:08:28,050
strong quality Peaks

111
0:08:28,050 --> 0:08:31,200
in these artifact regions is important

112
0:08:31,200 --> 0:08:37,890
to determine based calls manually

113
0:08:37,890 --> 0:08:40,560
as we visually inspect through the

114
0:08:40,560 --> 0:08:43,680
artifact we can check the calls above

115
0:08:43,680 --> 0:08:45,800
made by the software

116
0:08:45,800 --> 0:08:54,870
g-gee T G a G and here is an error this

117
0:08:54,870 --> 0:08:57,630
T call by the software is really

118
0:08:57,630 --> 0:09:07,890
supposed to be an a double click on the

119
0:09:07,890 --> 0:09:11,160
base call above the error in order to

120
0:09:11,160 --> 0:09:19,550
correct it

121
0:09:19,550 --> 0:09:24,230
save the file to keep your changes
