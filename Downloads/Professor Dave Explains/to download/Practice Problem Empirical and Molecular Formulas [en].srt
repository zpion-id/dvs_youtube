0:00:00,800 --> 0:00:07,230
science explains today let's get some

2
0:00:07,230 --> 0:00:09,030
practice on determining molecular

3
0:00:09,030 --> 0:00:12,690
formula so let's take a look at the

4
0:00:12,690 --> 0:00:15,839
question nicotine is a compound found in

5
0:00:15,839 --> 0:00:16,890
cigarettes

6
0:00:16,890 --> 0:00:19,770
if nicotine is seventy four point zero

7
0:00:19,770 --> 0:00:22,830
two percent carbon eight point seven one

8
0:00:22,830 --> 0:00:26,039
zero percent hydrogen and 17 point two

9
0:00:26,039 --> 0:00:29,939
seven percent nitrogen by mass and forty

10
0:00:29,939 --> 0:00:32,399
point five seven grams of nicotine is

11
0:00:32,399 --> 0:00:34,829
equal to zero point two five zero zero

12
0:00:34,829 --> 0:00:38,670
moles what is the molecular formula of

13
0:00:38,670 --> 0:00:41,399
nicotine so if you're not sure how to

14
0:00:41,399 --> 0:00:43,170
get this going go ahead and check out my

15
0:00:43,170 --> 0:00:46,320
tutorial on elemental analysis that is

16
0:00:46,320 --> 0:00:48,539
going to give you the strategy you need

17
0:00:48,539 --> 0:00:50,700
to answer this question and when you're

18
0:00:50,700 --> 0:01:11,280
ready go ahead and give it a shot so we

19
0:01:11,280 --> 0:01:13,380
have our mass percentages up at the top

20
0:01:13,380 --> 0:01:16,049
here and we also have our information

21
0:01:16,049 --> 0:01:18,299
that tells us that 40 point 5 7 grams of

22
0:01:18,299 --> 0:01:20,939
nicotine equals zero point two five zero

23
0:01:20,939 --> 0:01:23,520
zero moles of nicotine so what are we

24
0:01:23,520 --> 0:01:25,439
going to do with this information well

25
0:01:25,439 --> 0:01:27,240
the easiest way to do this is to go

26
0:01:27,240 --> 0:01:30,299
ahead and assume some mass of nicotine

27
0:01:30,299 --> 0:01:32,850
to start doing some calculations since

28
0:01:32,850 --> 0:01:34,890
it's totally arbitrary what mass we

29
0:01:34,890 --> 0:01:36,150
choose because we're dealing with

30
0:01:36,150 --> 0:01:38,850
percentages let's just use a hundred

31
0:01:38,850 --> 0:01:40,920
grams and make the math nice and easy on

32
0:01:40,920 --> 0:01:43,740
ourselves so if we have a hundred grams

33
0:01:43,740 --> 0:01:45,960
of nicotine that means we must have

34
0:01:45,960 --> 0:01:48,450
seventy four point zero two grams of

35
0:01:48,450 --> 0:01:51,329
carbon eight point seven one zero grams

36
0:01:51,329 --> 0:01:54,720
of hydrogen and 17 point two seven grams

37
0:01:54,720 --> 0:01:55,619
of nitrogen

38
0:01:55,619 --> 0:01
we're just taking those percentages

39
0:01 --> 0:01:59,310
which are out of a hundred and turning

40
0:01:59,310 --> 0:02:04,380
them into grams now we need to convert

41
0:02:04,380 --> 0:02:06,420
these into moles because masses don't

42
0:02:06,420 --> 0:02:07,950
tell us anything whenever we are doing

43
0:02:07,950 --> 0:02:09,780
calculations of this nature we always

44
0:02:09,780 --> 0:02:11,780
want moles so let's take our mass

45
0:02:11,780 --> 0:02:14,380
carbon and multiply by one mole over

46
0:02:14,380 --> 0:02:17,270
12.01 grams that is the atomic mass of

47
0:02:17,270 --> 0:02:21,050
carbon grams will cancel and we have 6

48
0:02:21,050 --> 0:02:23,690
point 1 6 3 moles of carbon in our

49
0:02:23,690 --> 0:02:26,780
hypothetical sample of nicotine now for

50
0:02:26,780 --> 0:02:29,410
hydrogen let's multiply by 1 mole over

51
0:02:29,410 --> 0:02:32,480
1.008 grams that is the atomic mass of

52
0:02:32,480 --> 0:02:35,810
hydrogen grams will cancel and we have

53
0:02:35,810 --> 0:02:38,090
eight point six two four moles of

54
0:02:38,090 --> 0:02:41,450
hydrogen lastly for nitrogen we multiply

55
0:02:41,450 --> 0:02:43,850
by one mole over fourteen point zero one

56
0:02:43,850 --> 0:02:46,120
grams that's the atomic mass of nitrogen

57
0:02:46,120 --> 0:02:49,040
grams will cancel and we have one point

58
0:02:49,040 --> 0:02:54,230
two three three moles of nitrogen so in

59
0:02:54,230 --> 0:02:56,810
this sample we have this many moles of

60
0:02:56,810 --> 0:02:59,390
each of these elements so this tells us

61
0:02:59,390 --> 0:03:01,250
something about the ratio of these

62
0:03:01,250 --> 0:03:03,769
elements in the compound so how can we

63
0:03:03,769 --> 0:03:05,690
get this in a way that's a little more

64
0:03:05,690 --> 0:03:10,370
useful what we can do is divide each of

65
0:03:10,370 --> 0:03:13,459
these values by the smallest so that we

66
0:03:13,459 --> 0:03:16,340
get one for the smallest one and then

67
0:03:16,340 --> 0:03:19,190
some ratio for the others and hopefully

68
0:03:19,190 --> 0:03:21,170
they'll turn out to be integers and that

69
0:03:21,170 --> 0:03:23,450
will give us the empirical formula so if

70
0:03:23,450 --> 0:03:25,370
we divide each of these by the smallest

71
0:03:25,370 --> 0:03:27,290
one of them which is one point two three

72
0:03:27,290 --> 0:03:30,829
three we end up with one mole of

73
0:03:30,829 --> 0:03:33,829
nitrogen and we also end up with integer

74
0:03:33,829 --> 0:03:35,870
values for carbon and hydrogen we have

75
0:03:35,870 --> 0:03:40,299
five and seven so that means for every

76
0:03:40,299 --> 0:03:43,640
nitrogen atom in the sample we have five

77
0:03:43,640 --> 0:03:46,310
carbon atoms and we have seven hydrogen

78
0:03:46,310 --> 0:03:48,680
atoms so that means the empirical

79
0:03:48,680 --> 0:03:53,720
formula of nicotine must be c5 h7n that

80
0:03:53,720 --> 0:03:55,700
is the only way for these mass

81
0:03:55,700 --> 0:03:57,680
percentages to work out the way that

82
0:03:57,680 --> 0:04:01,549
they are but once again we need the

83
0:04:01,549 --> 0:04:04,220
molecular formula in order to get that

84
0:04:04,220 --> 0:04:07,130
we need the molecular mass or the molar

85
0:04:07,130 --> 0:04:10,040
mass and so let's take this other bit of

86
0:04:10,040 --> 0:04:12,140
information we have if we want to know

87
0:04:12,140 --> 0:04:14,660
the molar mass of nicotine in grams per

88
0:04:14,660 --> 0:04:17,120
mole well we have forty point five seven

89
0:04:17,120 --> 0:04:19,160
grams and we can just divide that by

90
0:04:19,160 --> 0:04:21,320
zero point two five zero zero moles that

91
0:04:21,320 --> 0:04:23,960
will give us a value in grams per mole

92
0:04:23,960 --> 0:04:28,460
and so we get 160 2.3 grams per mole so

93
0:04:28,460 --> 0:04:32,630
how is that useful well we know that if

94
0:04:32,630 --> 0:04:34,819
we add up the masses of the 5 carbon

95
0:04:34,819 --> 0:04:37,250
atoms and the 7 hydrogen atoms and the 1

96
0:04:37,250 --> 0:04:40,340
nitrogen atom that adds up to 81 point 1

97
0:04:40,340 --> 0:04:43,400
3 grams per mole so that is the molar

98
0:04:43,400 --> 0:04:47,389
mass of one empirical formula unit now

99
0:04:47,389 --> 0:04:50,780
our molar mass is twice as much we have

100
0:04:50,780 --> 0:04:53,030
a two to one ratio so that means in

101
0:04:53,030 --> 0:04:55,340
order to get the molecular formula which

102
0:04:55,340 --> 0:04:57,770
represents the actual number of atoms of

103
0:04:57,770 --> 0:05:00,289
each element in the molecule all we need

104
0:05:00,289 --> 0:05:03,979
to do is double everything so let's take

105
0:05:03,979 --> 0:05:05,720
our empirical formula and put it in

106
0:05:05,720 --> 0:05:08,900
parentheses and multiply it by two if we

107
0:05:08,900 --> 0:05:10,699
double everything we'll get twice that

108
0:05:10,699 --> 0:05:13,310
mass and we will get our molar mass and

109
0:05:13,310 --> 0:05:15,620
that means that the molecular formula

110
0:05:15,620 --> 0:05:23,270
must be C 10 H 14 and 2 thanks for
