00:00:00,000 --> 0:00:02,700
hi guys I'm Jade lovely to meet you so

2
0:00:02,700 --> 0:00:04,319
the Schrodinger equation is one of those

3
0:00:04,319 --> 0:00:05,850
things that pops up a lot in like

4
0:00:05,850 --> 0:00:08,069
quantum science articles and journals

5
0:00:08,069 --> 0:00:10,650
and stuff but the journalist doesn't

6
0:00:10,650 --> 0:00:12,960
usually go into what it means which is

7
0:00:12,960 --> 0:00:14,969
fair because it's a fairly complex topic

8
0:00:14,969 --> 0:00:16,830
so today I just wanted to share with you

9
0:00:16,830 --> 0:00:19,050
guys like what it actually means so next

10
0:00:19,050 --> 0:00:21,570
time you read it in an article you can

11
0:00:21,570 --> 0:00:24,029
get a better gist of what it's about so

12
0:00:24,029 --> 0:00:25,740
the short version is the Schrodinger

13
0:00:25,740 --> 0:00:27,359
equation tells us everything we can

14
0:00:27,359 --> 0:00:28,949
possibly know about a quantum system

15
0:00:28,949 --> 0:00:31,289
it's basically the ethical ma of the

16
0:00:31,289 --> 0:00:33,239
quantum world if you throw a ball and

17
0:00:33,239 --> 0:00:34,469
self ethical MA

18
0:00:34,469 --> 0:00:35,880
you can predict its position and

19
0:00:35,880 --> 0:00:38,070
momentum for any moment in time once you

20
0:00:38,070 --> 0:00:40,050
have these two you can derive basically

21
0:00:40,050 --> 0:00:41,640
everything else you could possibly know

22
0:00:41,640 --> 0:00:45,059
about it velocity energy etc but when we

23
0:00:45,059 --> 0:00:46,829
get down to particle land Newton's

24
0:00:46,829 --> 0:00:48,510
equations don't work anymore

25
0:00:48,510 --> 0:00:50,340
if we put a particle in a box and we

26
0:00:50,340 --> 0:00:52,800
want to know where it is f equal MA just

27
0:00:52,800 --> 0:00:55,199
doesn't cut it the Heisenberg

28
0:00:55,199 --> 0:00:57,030
uncertainty principle says that we can't

29
0:00:57,030 --> 0:00:58,739
know both the exact position and

30
0:00:58,739 --> 0:01:01,800
momentum of quantum objects but we can

31
0:01:01,800 --> 0:01:04,049
know other things like the energy levels

32
0:01:04,049 --> 0:01:05,939
in the wavefunction which we'll explore

33
0:01:05,939 --> 0:01:08,040
in this video but that information is

34
0:01:08,040 --> 0:01:10,170
all inside the Schrodinger equation and

35
0:01:10,170 --> 0:01:12,180
with some hardcore mathematics we can

36
0:01:12,180 --> 0:01:15,509
tease it out now the long version so

37
0:01:15,509 --> 0:01:17,159
before I get started I should say that

38
0:01:17,159 --> 0:01:19,290
this is the time independent version

39
0:01:19,290 --> 0:01:22,439
meaning that it doesn't involve time and

40
0:01:22,439 --> 0:01:24,180
if at any point throughout the video you

41
0:01:24,180 --> 0:01:26,850
get lost don't worry even Schrodinger

42
0:01:26,850 --> 0:01:28,320
didn't know exactly what his equation

43
0:01:28,320 --> 0:01:30,210
meant so let's say we have a quantum

44
0:01:30,210 --> 0:01:32,759
system an electron in a box we want to

45
0:01:32,759 --> 0:01:34,350
know everything we can about this

46
0:01:34,350 --> 0:01:35,700
electron so we can make predictions

47
0:01:35,700 --> 0:01:37,259
where it might be

48
0:01:37,259 --> 0:01:39,479
what energy level it might be at these

49
0:01:39,479 --> 0:01:41,340
answers are all buried within the

50
0:01:41,340 --> 0:01:43,770
Schrodinger equation so first let's

51
0:01:43,770 --> 0:01:45,840
start with this guy the pitchbook thing

52
0:01:45,840 --> 0:01:47,909
this is the Greek letter sy and it

53
0:01:47,909 --> 0:01:49,350
stands for what's called the wave

54
0:01:49,350 --> 0:01:51,479
function it tells you where the electron

55
0:01:51,479 --> 0:01:54,659
is likely to be but not where it will be

56
0:01:54,659 --> 0:01:57,350
the quantum objects are sneaky in the

57
0:01:57,350 --> 0:01:58,850
you can't predict exactly where they'll

58
0:01:58,850 --> 0:02:01,100
be until you measure them you can only

59
0:02:01,100 --> 0:02:03,799
predict where they'll probably be say

60
0:02:03,799 --> 0:02:05,479
there's this kid you know you've grown

61
0:02:05,479 --> 0:02:07,220
up with them your whole life they looked

62
0:02:07,220 --> 0:02:08,690
in their room with their homework a

63
0:02:08,690 --> 0:02:10,850
Playstation and a bed if you had to

64
0:02:10,850 --> 0:02:12,260
guess where they were you'd say there's

65
0:02:12,260 --> 0:02:14,420
about an 80% probability they're on the

66
0:02:14,420 --> 0:02:17,030
PlayStation and 19% probability they're

67
0:02:17,030 --> 0:02:19,069
in bed and a 1% probability they're

68
0:02:19,069 --> 0:02:20,840
doing their homework when you open the

69
0:02:20,840 --> 0:02:22,700
door you'll know for sure but you were

70
0:02:22,700 --> 0:02:24,590
able to make these predictions because

71
0:02:24,590 --> 0:02:26,600
you know this guy what if you had to

72
0:02:26,600 --> 0:02:28,280
guess where this electron is you don't

73
0:02:28,280 --> 0:02:30,980
know this electron well that's what the

74
0:02:30,980 --> 0:02:33,230
wavefunction tells us it gives us the

75
0:02:33,230 --> 0:02:35,480
probabilities of where it's likely to be

76
0:02:35,480 --> 0:02:38,060
but a big difference is that while the

77
0:02:38,060 --> 0:02:40,580
guy is only in one place at a time the

78
0:02:40,580 --> 0:02:42,650
electron is in a superposition of all

79
0:02:42,650 --> 0:02:45,500
possible places at the same time you may

80
0:02:45,500 --> 0:02:47,030
have heard the famous thought experiment

81
0:02:47,030 --> 0:02:48,709
Schrodinger's cat who's in a

82
0:02:48,709 --> 0:02:50,870
superposition of being dead and alive

83
0:02:50,870 --> 0:02:52,850
until the box is opened and it's forced

84
0:02:52,850 --> 0:02:55,340
to choose a state it's the same deal

85
0:02:55,340 --> 0:02:57,350
here the act of not knowing where the

86
0:02:57,350 --> 0:02:59,060
electron is allows it's probability

87
0:02:59,060 --> 0:03:01,100
distribution to be spread out over a

88
0:03:01,100 --> 0:03:02,810
large space kind of like a wave

89
0:03:02,810 --> 0:03:04,579
different kinds of waves can represent

90
0:03:04,579 --> 0:03:06,380
different probabilities of where it's

91
0:03:06,380 --> 0:03:08,780
likely to be hence the name wave

92
0:03:08,780 --> 0:03:10,850
function it's a function that describes

93
0:03:10,850 --> 0:03:12,799
the wave shape of probability

94
0:03:12,799 --> 0:03:14,630
distribution of the electron

95
0:03:14,630 --> 0:03:16,310
oh yeah and when you open the door and

96
0:03:16,310 --> 0:03:17,690
measure where it is this wave

97
0:03:17,690 --> 0:03:20,209
probability cloud function collapses and

98
0:03:20,209 --> 0:03:22,070
the electron becomes a particle again no

99
0:03:22,070 --> 0:03:23,930
one too sure to go was confused so

100
0:03:23,930 --> 0:03:25,519
that's what the pitch both means the

101
0:03:25,519 --> 0:03:26,870
wave function tells us where our

102
0:03:26,870 --> 0:03:29,120
electron is likely to be now let's take

103
0:03:29,120 --> 0:03:31,400
a look at this a it represents the

104
0:03:31,400 --> 0:03:33,440
energies the electron is allowed to have

105
0:03:33,440 --> 0:03:35,570
now before I go into what that means I

106
0:03:35,570 --> 0:03:37,070
just want to point out that the way this

107
0:03:37,070 --> 0:03:39,200
equation is arranged these values are

108
0:03:39,200 --> 0:03:40,970
the ones we're trying to solve for so

109
0:03:40,970 --> 0:03:42,980
it's telling us that hey if you do all

110
0:03:42,980 --> 0:03:45,230
this stuff you can find out the energy

111
0:03:45,230 --> 0:03:46,670
levels of the wave functions of the

112
0:03:46,670 --> 0:03:48,920
electron and if we know these two things

113
0:03:48,920 --> 0:03:50,720
we can derive everything else we can

114
0:03:50,720 --> 0:03:52,609
possibly know about the particle just

115
0:03:52,609 --> 0:03:54,650
like the position and momentum of wool

116
0:03:54,650 --> 0:03:57,350
but let's backtrack a sec what do I mean

117
0:03:57,350 --> 0:03:59,450
when I say energy levels the electron is

118
0:03:59,450 --> 0:04:01,430
allowed to have like it's a grown

119
0:04:01,430 --> 0:04:02,630
electron it can have whatever energy

120
0:04:02,630 --> 0:04:05,900
levels at once right well know in the

121
0:04:05,900 --> 0:04:07,580
regular world we see around

122
0:04:07,580 --> 0:04:09,230
and if you can go up and down in a

123
0:04:09,230 --> 0:04:11,690
smooth continuous way but this isn't the

124
0:04:11,690 --> 0:04:13,700
case in the quantum world and the reason

125
0:04:13,700 --> 0:04:15,440
comes from the wave-like nature of the

126
0:04:15,440 --> 0:04:17,630
probability distributions because our

127
0:04:17,630 --> 0:04
particle is inside the box it has a zero

128
0:04 --> 0:04:22,220
probability of being found in or outside

129
0:04:22,220 --> 0:04:24,470
the wall so this means the wavefunction

130
0:04:24,470 --> 0:04:26,870
always needs to be zero there otherwise

131
0:04:26,870 --> 0:04:28,550
there's some probability that the

132
0:04:28,550 --> 0:04:30,770
electron could be outside the box which

133
0:04:30,770 --> 0:04:32,750
we know it's not that means that the

134
0:04:32,750 --> 0:04:34,070
electron can only have certain

135
0:04:34,070 --> 0:04:36,350
frequencies associated with it this

136
0:04:36,350 --> 0:04:38,060
frequency is allowed as the wave

137
0:04:38,060 --> 0:04:40,460
function is zero in both edges and this

138
0:04:40,460 --> 0:04:43,280
frequency is not this frequency is

139
0:04:43,280 --> 0:04:46,040
allowed and this one is not so Einstein

140
0:04:46,040 --> 0:04:48,260
discovered that energy is actually

141
0:04:48,260 --> 0:04:50,300
proportional to frequency by this

142
0:04:50,300 --> 0:04:53,390
relation e equals H F where E is the

143
0:04:53,390 --> 0:04:56,180
energy F is the frequency and this H

144
0:04:56,180 --> 0:04:58,370
here is Planck's constant don't worry

145
0:04:58,370 --> 0:04:59,990
too much about that H for now all you

146
0:04:59,990 --> 0:05:01,610
need to know is that it's a constant

147
0:05:01,610 --> 0:05:03,920
which means its value doesn't change so

148
0:05:03,920 --> 0:05:05,690
if only certain frequencies are allowed

149
0:05:05,690 --> 0:05:08,180
inside the box and this is a constant

150
0:05:08,180 --> 0:05:10,520
then it follows that only certain energy

151
0:05:10,520 --> 0:05:13,520
levels are allowed inside the box - this

152
0:05:13,520 --> 0:05:16,040
property of discrete or quantized values

153
0:05:16,040 --> 0:05:17,900
is where quantum mechanics gets its name

154
0:05:17,900 --> 0:05:20,060
things that can take on continuous

155
0:05:20,060 --> 0:05:22,310
values in the regular world like energy

156
0:05:22,310 --> 0:05:24,169
levels can only take on certain

157
0:05:24,169 --> 0:05:26,630
quantized values at the quantum scale

158
0:05:26,630 --> 0:05:28,850
now let's look at the other side of the

159
0:05:28,850 --> 0:05:30,620
equation we know what we're solving for

160
0:05:30,620 --> 0:05:32,750
the energy levels and the wave functions

161
0:05:32,750 --> 0:05:35,510
but how is all of this going to help us

162
0:05:35,510 --> 0:05:38,480
get there well overall energy is made up

163
0:05:38,480 --> 0:05:40,730
of kinetic energy and potential energy

164
0:05:40,730 --> 0:05:42,500
if a skateboarder is on a skate ramp

165
0:05:42,500 --> 0:05:44,330
they'll be traveling at some speed and

166
0:05:44,330 --> 0:05:45,980
have some kinetic energy but when they

167
0:05:45,980 --> 0:05:48,290
stop at the top they still have energy

168
0:05:48,290 --> 0:05:50,120
it's just transformed into a different

169
0:05:50,120 --> 0:05:52,790
kind potential energy the entire energy

170
0:05:52,790 --> 0:05:54,890
of the system is just the kinetic energy

171
0:05:54,890 --> 0:05:56,780
plus the potential energy and while it

172
0:05:56,780 --> 0:05:58,220
can move back and forth between those

173
0:05:58,220 --> 0:06:00,530
two states its total value is always

174
0:06:00,530 --> 0:06:03,860
conserved sometimes potential energy is

175
0:06:03,860 --> 0:06:06,229
written as a V so this term is the

176
0:06:06,229 --> 0:06:08,720
potential energy of the wave function so

177
0:06:08,720 --> 0:06:10,610
if this is the potential energy that

178
0:06:10,610 --> 0:06:12,350
must mean that this term here is the

179
0:06:12,350 --> 0:06:14,300
kinetic energy I know it doesn't really

180
0:06:14,300 --> 0:06:15,919
look like any kind of kinetic energy

181
0:06:15,919 --> 0:06:17,450
equation we've seen before right so

182
0:06:17,450 --> 0:06:18,680
here's the derivation if you don't

183
0:06:18,680 --> 0:06:20,419
believe me so if we can solve for the

184
0:06:20,419 --> 0:06:21,009
potential

185
0:06:21,009 --> 0:06:22,749
kinetic energy of our quantum system

186
0:06:22,749 --> 0:06:24,309
this will tell us the energy levels

187
0:06:24,309 --> 0:06:25,960
allowed and that's everything there is

188
0:06:25,960 --> 0:06:28,180
to know about our little electron so

189
0:06:28,180 --> 0:06:29,740
what would some typical Schrodinger

190
0:06:29,740 --> 0:06:31,689
solutions look like well to this

191
0:06:31,689 --> 0:06:32,830
particular problem

192
0:06:32,830 --> 0:06:34,689
all the solutions to the wave functions

193
0:06:34,689 --> 0:06:37,029
take these two forms and the energy

194
0:06:37,029 --> 0:06:39,399
equation that popped out was this great

195
0:06:39,399 --> 0:06:40,839
shape so what the hell does that mean

196
0:06:40,839 --> 0:06:42,369
well the first thing to note is that

197
0:06:42,369 --> 0:06:44,439
every term in this expression is either

198
0:06:44,439 --> 0:06:47,289
a constant or a whole number h-bar is a

199
0:06:47,289 --> 0:06:50,649
constant 2 is obviously a constant M the

200
0:06:50,649 --> 0:06:53,199
mass of the electron is a constant pi is

201
0:06:53,199 --> 0:06:55,809
a constant and L the length of the box

202
0:06:55,809 --> 0:06:58,180
is a constant and n stands for the

203
0:06:58,180 --> 0:06:59,919
different states of the electron and

204
0:06:59,919 --> 0:07:03,999
they're all whole numbers 1 2 3 etc so

205
0:07:03,999 --> 0:07:06,430
then the energy e can only have certain

206
0:07:06,430 --> 0:07:09,639
values it's quantized but what about the

207
0:07:09,639 --> 0:07:13,059
wave function where is the electron well

208
0:07:13,059 --> 0:07:14,680
let's look at this guy when the electron

209
0:07:14,680 --> 0:07:16,629
is in its first energy state when n is

210
0:07:16,629 --> 0:07:20,319
equal to 1 we get this that's one of the

211
0:07:20,319 --> 0:07:22,209
wave functions of the electron and if we

212
0:07:22,209 --> 0:07:23,639
square it we get the probability

213
0:07:23,639 --> 0:07:24,789
distribution

214
0:07:24,789 --> 0:07:27,219
aka where the electron is likely to be

215
0:07:27,219 --> 0:07:28,659
we can see that there's a high

216
0:07:28,659 --> 0:07:30,370
probability that it'll be found in the

217
0:07:30,370 --> 0:07:32,110
middle here but as zero probability

218
0:07:32,110 --> 0:07:34,779
it'll be found right at the edges here

219
0:07:34,779 --> 0:07:35,979
are some more wave functions and

220
0:07:35,979 --> 0:07:37,689
probability densities for other energy

221
0:07:37,689 --> 0:07:39,699
states see how the wave function is

222
0:07:39,699 --> 0:07:43,509
always always 0 right at the edges this

223
0:07:43,509 --> 0:07:45,639
took me an entire semester of a physics

224
0:07:45,639 --> 0:07:47,259
degree to understand and what really

225
0:07:47,259 --> 0:07:48,969
helped me was working through a lot of

226
0:07:48,969 --> 0:07:50,830
problems and taking the time to build a

227
0:07:50,830 --> 0:07:53,080
strong intuition brilliant org has an

228
0:07:53,080 --> 0:07:54,879
entire course dedicated to quantum

229
0:07:54,879 --> 0:07:56,469
mechanics which starts with the

230
0:07:56,469 --> 0:07:58,180
experiments which first discovered

231
0:07:58,180 --> 0:07:59,979
quantum behavior and leads up to the

232
0:07:59,979 --> 0:08:01,269
derivation of the Schrodinger equation

233
0:08:01,269 --> 0:08:03,729
it has examples you can work through at

234
0:08:03,729 --> 0:08:05,559
your own pace I actually just went

235
0:08:05,559 --> 0:08:07,149
through it to refresh my memory and

236
0:08:07,149 --> 0:08:08,800
learn some things I didn't know and

237
0:08:08,800 --> 0:08:10,539
definitely understood some things better

238
0:08:10,539 --> 0:08:12,639
they also have heaps of other courses

239
0:08:12,639 --> 0:08:14,589
mainly on physics math and computer

240
0:08:14,589 --> 0:08:16,059
science and they're always adding more

discount just go to brilliant org slash

244
0:08:22,959 --> 0:08:25,959
up and Adam the link is on screen and in

245
0:08:25,959 --> 0:08:27,759
the description and if you're wondering

246
0:08:27,759 --> 0:08:29,769
why I didn't include the math behind the

247
0:08:29,769 --> 0:08:31,029
solutions to the Schrodinger equation

248
0:08:31,029 --> 0:08:32,979
it's because it would have taken me

249
0:08:32,979 --> 0:08:34,840
about an hour just to write out

250
0:08:34,840 --> 0:08:36,880
probably another five weeks to explain

251
0:08:36,880 --> 0:08:38,740
but for those of you who are especially

252
0:08:38,740 --> 0:08:41,440
curious I've posted my final exam essay

253
0:08:41,440 --> 0:08:43,540
on quantum physics in the description it

254
0:08:43,540 --> 0:08:44,920
includes the derivation of the

255
0:08:44,920 --> 0:08:46,480
Schrodinger equation as well as the

256
0:08:46,480 --> 0:08:48,640
solutions and some other interesting

257
0:08:48,640 --> 0:08:50,260
stuff like random questions to my

258
0:08:50,260 --> 0:08:52,450
professor so guys please be honest do

259
0:08:52,450 --> 0:08:53,740
you understand the Schrodinger equation

260
0:08:53,740 --> 0:08:56,530
a bit better now I hope you do but if

261
0:08:56,530 --> 0:08:58,750
you don't please feel free to give me

262
0:08:58,750 --> 0:09:00,610
any feedback on how I can make my

263
0:09:00,610 --> 0:09:02,740
explanations better for future videos

264
0:09:02,740 --> 0:09:04,900
quantum physics is so cool and I really

265
0:09:04,900 --> 0:09:07,300
don't want anybody to miss out so yeah

266
0:09:07,300 --> 0:09:08,910
that's all from me bye
