1
0:00:00,320 --> 0:00:02,080
math is the language that we use to

2
0:00:02,080 --> 0:00:03,600
describe the laws of nature as

3
0:00:03,600 --> 0:00:05,600
physicists and there's no way around it

4
0:00:05,600 --> 0:00:07,359
if you want to understand physics you're

5
0:00:07,359 --> 0:00:09,519
going to have to learn a lot of math and

6
0:00:09,519 --> 0:00:11,840
if i had to pick one formula that's the

7
0:00:11,840 --> 0:00:13,920
most important for understanding physics

8
0:00:13,920 --> 0:00:16,560
it would be this one taylor's formula it

9
0:00:16,560 --> 0:00:18,560
shows up in virtually everything we do

10
0:00:18,560 --> 0:00:20,640
in physics and in this video i want to

11
0:00:20,640 --> 0:00:22,640
explain how it works and give you a few

12
0:00:22,640 --> 0:00:24,640
examples of its importance in different

13
0:00:24,640 --> 0:00:26,720
corners of physics you probably learned

14
0:00:26,720 --> 0:00:28,320
this theorem before if you've taken a

15
0:00:28,320 --> 0:00:30,160
calculus class though you might not have

16
0:00:30,160 --> 0:00:31,679
written it in this nice and compact

17
0:00:31,679 --> 0:00:33,520
notation i'll show you that it's

18
0:00:33,520 --> 0:00:35,280
equivalent to the taylor series that

19
0:00:35,280 --> 0:00:37,680
lets us expand any smooth function in

20
0:00:37,680 --> 0:00:39,040
powers of x

21
0:00:39,040 --> 0:00:40,800
in the first half of the video i'm going

22
0:00:40,800 --> 0:00:42,559
to explain where this incredibly

23
0:00:42,559 --> 0:00:44,320
important formula comes from and what it

24
0:00:44,320 --> 0:00:46,559
means and then in the second half i'll

25
0:00:46,559 --> 0:00:48,640
tell you about three applications in

26
0:00:48,640 --> 0:00:50,640
physics where it shows up though again

27
0:00:50,640 --> 0:00:52,399
you'd be hard-pressed to find a chapter

28
0:00:52,399 --> 0:00:54,559
of any physics textbook where it's not

29
0:00:54,559 --> 0:00:56,960
applied number one we'll look at how the

30
0:00:56,960 --> 0:00:59,120
taylor series enables us to understand

31
0:00:59,120 --> 0:01:01,520
the complicated equations we often need

32
0:01:01,520 --> 0:01:03,760
to solve in physics by studying a limit

33
0:01:03,760 --> 0:01:06,320
where the equations simplify second i'll

34
0:01:06,320 --> 0:01:08,560
show you how einstein's e equals m c

35
0:01:08,560 --> 0:01:10,720
squared or actually his more general

36
0:01:10,720 --> 0:01:12,880
formula for the energy of a relativistic

37
0:01:12,880 --> 0:01:15,360
particle of mass m and momentum p

38
0:01:15,360 --> 0:01:17,439
correctly reproduces the more familiar

39
0:01:17,439 --> 0:01:19,920
kinetic energy one-half mv squared for

40
0:01:19,920 --> 0:01:21,759
particles that aren't moving too close

41
0:01:21,759 --> 0:01:24,080
to the speed of light and also how that

42
0:01:24,080 --> 0:01:26,400
same taylor series leads to the fine

43
0:01:26,400 --> 0:01:28,240
structure of the energy levels of the

44
0:01:28,240 --> 0:01:30,479
hydrogen atom and third we'll look at

45
0:01:30,479 --> 0:01:32,560
how taylor's formula leads directly to

46
0:01:32,560 --> 0:01:34,799
the definition of the momentum operator

47
0:01:34,799 --> 0:01:36,960
in quantum mechanics i'm not assuming

48
0:01:36,960 --> 0:01:38,560
you've learned much about relativity or

49
0:01:38,560 --> 0:01:40,560
quantum mechanics before by the way the

50
0:01:40,560 --> 0:01:42,079
point is just to see some of the

51
0:01:42,079 --> 0:01:43,680
different ways that taylor's formula

52
0:01:43,680 --> 0:01:46,240
shows up in different areas of physics

53
0:01:46,240 --> 0:01:47,840
so let's start with the math and

54
0:01:47,840 --> 0:01:49,520
understand what this formula is all

55
0:01:49,520 --> 0:01:52,240
about say we have some function f x

56
0:01:52,240 --> 0:01:54,159
here's a random example it looks really

57
0:01:54,159 --> 0:01:56,079
complicated but instead of trying to

58
0:01:56,079 --> 0:01:57,680
understand the whole complicated

59
0:01:57,680 --> 0:02:00,240
function at once let's zoom in and look

60
0:02:00,240 --> 0:02:01,920
at it in a smaller region where it's a

61
0:02:01,920 --> 0:02:03,920
lot simpler take this point here for

62
0:02:03,920 --> 0:02:06,320
example and let's choose our origin so

63
0:02:06,320 --> 0:02:08,080
that this point is sitting at x equals

64
0:02:08,080 --> 0:02:09,920
zero so the height of the function there

65
0:02:09,920 --> 0:02:12,640
is f of zero imagine that this curve is

66
0:02:12,640 --> 0:02:14,560
the shape of a treacherous mountain and

67
0:02:14,560 --> 0:02:16,800
you're an intrepid explorer plotting out

68
0:02:16,800 --> 0:02:18,879
its map you're high up in the air and

69
0:02:18,879 --> 0:02:20,959
it's very foggy so you can't see very

70
0:02:20,959 --> 0:02:22,400
far in either direction

71
0:02:22,400 --> 0:02:24,080
you just need to carefully walk along

72
0:02:24,080 --> 0:02:26,160
the mountain and record its shape using

73
0:02:26,160 --> 0:02
an altimeter that measures your height

74
0:02 --> 0:02:29,760
above the ground starting from this

75
0:02:29,760 --> 0:02:32,480
point x equals zero initially all you

76
0:02:32,480 --> 0:02:34,239
can say is that your starting height is

77
0:02:34,239 --> 0:02:36,400
f zero for all you know the whole

78
0:02:36,400 --> 0:02:38,640
mountain might just be a flat horizontal

79
0:02:38,640 --> 0:02:40,879
line at this height then when you try to

80
0:02:40,879 --> 0:02:42,640
write down in your field journal a

81
0:02:42,640 --> 0:02:44,080
function that describes the height of

82
0:02:44,080 --> 0:02:46,239
the mountain your first guess is just f

83
0:02:46,239 --> 0:02:49,200
of x equals f of zero a horizontal line

84
0:02:49,200 --> 0:02:50,640
at your starting height

85
0:02:50,640 --> 0:02:52,160
but now you take a little hop to the

86
0:02:52,160 --> 0:02:53,920
right and you discover that the height

87
0:02:53,920 --> 0:02:56,319
of the mountain has changed so it's not

88
0:02:56,319 --> 0:02:58,800
actually a horizontal line instead as

89
0:02:58,800 --> 0:03:00,720
far as you can tell now it looks like a

90
0:03:00,720 --> 0:03:02,879
line that's sloped at an angle where the

91
0:03:02,879 --> 0:03:04,879
slope is given by the first derivative

92
0:03:04,879 --> 0:03:06,959
of f at x equals 0.

93
0:03:06,959 --> 0:03:08,879
now your new best guess for the height

94
0:03:08,879 --> 0:03:10,800
function is the equation of this sloped

95
0:03:10,800 --> 0:03:14,080
line f of x equals f of 0 plus f prime

96
0:03:14,080 --> 0:03:16,480
of 0 times x but now you take another

97
0:03:16,480 --> 0:03:18,480
hop and you discover that the curve

98
0:03:18,480 --> 0:03:20,959
isn't a straight line after all instead

99
0:03:20,959 --> 0:03:22,879
it starts to deflect away from a line

100
0:03:22,879 --> 0:03:25,120
like a parabola so now you expect

101
0:03:25,120 --> 0:03:26,640
there's a better approximation to the

102
0:03:26,640 --> 0:03:28,879
function like this with an x squared

103
0:03:28,879 --> 0:03:30,959
term and some coefficient a in front of

104
0:03:30,959 --> 0:03:33,040
it but at this point you start to think

105
0:03:33,040 --> 0:03:34,640
to yourself that you might be able to

106
0:03:34,640 --> 0:03:36,319
get an even better description of the

107
0:03:36,319 --> 0:03:38,799
function over a wider range by including

108
0:03:38,799 --> 0:03:41,680
many more powers of x x cubed x to the

109
0:03:41,680 --> 0:03:44,159
fourth and so on so you stop exploring

110
0:03:44,159 --> 0:03:45,840
for a moment and sit down to do some

111
0:03:45,840 --> 0:03:46,640
math

112
0:03:46,640 --> 0:03:49,040
you want to express this function f as a

113
0:03:49,040 --> 0:03:50,959
sum of powers of x with some

114
0:03:50,959 --> 0:03:54,640
coefficients c0 c1 c2 and so on the

115
0:03:54,640 --> 0:03:57,120
question is how to pick these numbers so

116
0:03:57,120 --> 0:03:59,040
that this series does a good job of

117
0:03:59,040 --> 0:04:00,400
matching up with f

118
0:04:00,400 --> 0:04:01,840
well we've already seen what the first

119
0:04:01,840 --> 0:04:03,920
couple of coefficients are when we plug

120
0:04:03,920 --> 0:04:06,159
in x equals 0 everything except the

121
0:04:06,159 --> 0:04:08,879
first term disappears and we get f 0

122
0:04:08,879 --> 0:04:11,120
equals c 0. so that first number in the

123
0:04:11,120 --> 0:04:13,200
series is just the value of the function

124
0:04:13,200 --> 0:04:15,599
at our starting point x equals zero as

125
0:04:15,599 --> 0:04:18,079
for the next one c one x and everything

126
0:04:18,079 --> 0:04:19,919
after it disappears when we plug in x

127
0:04:19,919 --> 0:04:21,519
equals zero but what if we take the

128
0:04:21,519 --> 0:04
derivative first remembering the rule

129
0:04 --> 0:04:25,919
that to take the derivative of x to the

130
0:04:25,919 --> 0:04:28,160
n we bring the power down out front and

131
0:04:28,160 --> 0:04:30,800
then reduce the exponent by one we get f

132
0:04:30,800 --> 0:04:33,840
prime of x equals c one plus two c two

133
0:04:33,840 --> 0:04:36,880
times x plus three c three x squared

134
0:04:36,880 --> 0:04:39,360
plus dot dot dot now when we plug in x

135
0:04:39,360 --> 0:04:42,080
equals zero the c one term survives f

136
0:04:42,080 --> 0:04:44,880
prime of 0 equals c1 so again like we

137
0:04:44,880 --> 0:04:46,560
already knew we should set this first

138
0:04:46,560 --> 0:04:49,280
coefficient c1 to be the derivative of f

139
0:04:49,280 --> 0:04:51,360
at x equals 0. but now we've got the

140
0:04:51,360 --> 0:04:53,919
idea if we take the derivative again we

141
0:04:53,919 --> 0:04:56,720
get f double prime of x equals two c two

142
0:04:56,720 --> 0:04:59,759
plus three times two c three x and so on

143
0:04:59,759 --> 0:05:02,160
and so when we plug in x equals zero we

144
0:05:02,160 --> 0:05:03,919
learned that f double prime of zero

145
0:05:03,919 --> 0:05:06,240
equals two c two then we should choose c

146
0:05:06,240 --> 0:05:08,720
two to be half the second derivative of

147
0:05:08,720 --> 0:05:11,680
f at x equals zero and on and on it goes

148
0:05:11,680 --> 0:05:13,680
hopefully you see the pattern for the x

149
0:05:13,680 --> 0:05:15,680
to the n term in the sum we need to take

150
0:05:15,680 --> 0:05:18,160
the derivative n times until this is the

151
0:05:18,160 --> 0:05:20,320
only term that's around when we plug in

152
0:05:20,320 --> 0:05:22,560
x equals zero each derivative brings

153
0:05:22,560 --> 0:05:25,759
down a power first n then n minus 1 n

154
0:05:25,759 --> 0:05:28,479
minus 2 and so on all the way down to 3

155
0:05:28,479 --> 0:05:31,280
2 1. in other words the nth derivative

156
0:05:31,280 --> 0:05:34,400
is n factorial times c n so the nth

157
0:05:34,400 --> 0:05:37,039
coefficient is 1 over n factorial times

158
0:05:37,039 --> 0:05:39,759
the nth derivative of f evaluated at x

159
0:05:39,759 --> 0:05
equals 0. for this x cubed term for

160
0:05 --> 0:05:44,400
example we get 1 over 3 factorial which

161
0:05:44,400 --> 0:05:46,800
is 1 6 times the third derivative of f

162
0:05:46,800 --> 0:05:49,199
at 0. by the way i go through all this

163
0:05:49,199 --> 0:05:50,960
step by step in the notes which you can

164
0:05:50,960 --> 0:05:52,639
get at the link in the description to

165
0:05:52,639 --> 0:05:54,240
dig through all the details here after

166
0:05:54,240 --> 0:05:55,280
you've watched

167
0:05:55,280 --> 0:05:57,280
now we're in business we've written an

168
0:05:57,280 --> 0:05:59,520
approximation for our function f as a

169
0:05:59,520 --> 0:06:02,160
sum of powers of x this is the taylor

170
0:06:02,160 --> 0:06:04,800
series for f when x is tiny so that

171
0:06:04,800 --> 0:06:06,560
we're close to the starting point here

172
0:06:06,560 --> 0:06:09,360
each higher power of x is an even tinier

173
0:06:09,360 --> 0:06:11,280
number than the one that came before it

174
0:06:11,280 --> 0:06:12,720
and so we already get a good

175
0:06:12,720 --> 0:06:14,639
approximation by keeping just the first

176
0:06:14,639 --> 0:06:17,280
few terms in the series the farther away

177
0:06:17,280 --> 0:06:19,440
we venture from x equals 0 the more

178
0:06:19,440 --> 0:06:21,440
terms we need to include in the series

179
0:06:21,440 --> 0:06:22,880
in order to get a good description of

180
0:06:22,880 --> 0:06:24,479
the function but now that we have the

181
0:06:24,479 --> 0:06:26,400
general formula for the coefficients we

182
0:06:26,400 --> 0:06:28,400
can include as many terms as we like

183
0:06:28,400 --> 0:06:29,600
here's what it looks like for this

184
0:06:29,600 --> 0:06:31,360
function as we make the total number of

185
0:06:31,360 --> 0:06:33,759
terms bigger and bigger you can see that

186
0:06:33,759 --> 0:06:35,759
the series approximation matches the

187
0:06:35,759 --> 0:06:38,720
curve better and better as n gets large

188
0:06:38,720 --> 0:06:40,639
and here's the kicker when we include

189
0:06:40,639 --> 0:06:42,720
all the terms by summing up the infinite

190
0:06:42,720 --> 0:06:45,360
series over all powers of x we actually

191
0:06:45,360 --> 0:06:47,360
reproduce the exact function that we

192
0:06:47,360 --> 0:06:49,280
started with as long as it was smooth

193
0:06:49,280 --> 0:06:50,720
and well behaved and the series

194
0:06:50,720 --> 0:06:51,840
converges

195
0:06:51,840 --> 0:06:54,720
this is truly remarkable it says that if

196
0:06:54,720 --> 0:06:56,639
we know all the derivatives of a smooth

197
0:06:56,639 --> 0:06:58,319
function at a single point we can

198
0:06:58,319 --> 0:07:00,080
reconstruct the rest of the function

199
0:07:00,080 --> 0:07:02,479
everywhere else let's do some examples

200
0:07:02,479 --> 0:07:04,800
how about f of x equals sine of x let's

201
0:07:04,800 --> 0:07:06,720
write down its taylor series around x

202
0:07:06,720 --> 0:07:08,800
equals 0. we just need to know what its

203
0:07:08,800 --> 0:07:10,800
derivatives are at that point so let's

204
0:07:10,800 --> 0:07:12,160
make a little table

205
0:07:12,160 --> 0:07:14,479
sine of x passes through the origin so

206
0:07:14,479 --> 0:07:17,199
we start off with f of zero equals zero

207
0:07:17,199 --> 0:07:19,440
zero factorial is defined to be one by

208
0:07:19,440 --> 0:07:21,120
the way and so this first term in the

209
0:07:21,120 --> 0:07:23,759
taylor series is just zero next up we

210
0:07:23,759 --> 0:07:25,520
need the derivative of sine of x which

211
0:07:25,520 --> 0:07:27,919
is cosine of x now when we plug in x

212
0:07:27,919 --> 0:07:30,160
equals zero we get cosine of 0 which is

213
0:07:30,160 --> 0:07:32,479
1. and so the first interesting term in

214
0:07:32,479 --> 0:07:34,880
the taylor series is just x a straight

215
0:07:34,880 --> 0:07:37,199
line through the origin with slope 1.

216
0:07:37,199 --> 0:07:39,199
that's already a very good approximation

217
0:07:39,199 --> 0:07:41,440
to sine of x when x is a small number

218
0:07:41,440 --> 0:07:43,520
and so we use the approximation sine of

219
0:07:43,520 --> 0:07
x equals x often in physics but as x

220
0:07 --> 0:07:47,680
gets a little bigger clearly the

221
0:07:47,680 --> 0:07:49,199
straight line isn't going to cut it

222
0:07:49,199 --> 0:07:51,360
anymore so let's keep going for the next

223
0:07:51,360 --> 0:07:53,520
term we need the derivative of cosine of

224
0:07:53,520 --> 0:07:55,759
x which is minus sine of x but that

225
0:07:55,759 --> 0:07:57,759
vanishes again when x equals zero and so

226
0:07:57,759 --> 0:08
the x squared term actually disappears

227
0:08 --> 0:08:01,599
that's part of the reason the linear

228
0:08:01,599 --> 0:08:04,240
approximation was so good to begin with

229
0:08:04,240 --> 0:08:06,400
now for f triple prime of x we need the

230
0:08:06,400 --> 0:08:08,479
derivative of minus sine and we get

231
0:08:08,479 --> 0:08:11,360
minus cosine then f triple prime of zero

232
0:08:11,360 --> 0:08:13,280
equals minus one and so the qubit

233
0:08:13,280 --> 0:08:15,440
coefficient is minus one over three

234
0:08:15,440 --> 0:08:16,639
factorial

235
0:08:16,639 --> 0:08:18,400
let's do one more line we want the

236
0:08:18,400 --> 0:08:21,039
derivative of minus cosine which is sine

237
0:08:21,039 --> 0:08:22,960
this vanishes again when we plug in x

238
0:08:22,960 --> 0:08:24,960
equals zero and so there's no x to the

239
0:08:24,960 --> 0:08:26,400
four term in the series

240
0:08:26,400 --> 0:08:27,919
we could keep going like this and take

241
0:08:27,919 --> 0:08:29,840
more derivatives but notice that with

242
0:08:29,840 --> 0:08:31,520
the fourth derivative here we've just

243
0:08:31,520 --> 0:08:33,120
gotten back to where we started with

244
0:08:33,120 --> 0:08:35,680
sine of x so this same sequence of four

245
0:08:35,680 --> 0:08:37,440
derivatives is just going to repeat

246
0:08:37,440 --> 0:08:39,599
itself over and over again then we can

247
0:08:39,599 --> 0:08:41,440
just write down the whole series without

248
0:08:41,440 --> 0:08:44,080
any more work the next term is x to the

249
0:08:44,080 --> 0:08:46,480
fifth over five factorial followed by

250
0:08:46,480 --> 0:08:48,959
minus one over seven factorial x to the

251
0:08:48,959 --> 0:08:51,839
seventh and plus one over nine factorial

252
0:08:51,839 --> 0:08:54,320
x to the nine and so on here's what it

253
0:08:54,320 --> 0:08:56,720
looks like going up to x to the 29 you

254
0:08:56,720 --> 0:08:58,320
can see that it does a good job

255
0:08:58,320 --> 0:09:00,080
reproducing the sine curve right up to

256
0:09:00,080 --> 0:09:02,320
the edges of these four periods

257
0:09:02,320 --> 0:09:04,880
notice that only odd powers of x show up

258
0:09:04,880 --> 0:09:06,880
here in the taylor series that's because

259
0:09:06,880 --> 0:09:09,279
sine of x is an odd function when you

260
0:09:09,279 --> 0:09:11,120
compare it on the right and left sides

261
0:09:11,120 --> 0:09:13,600
of the y axis it looks the same except

262
0:09:13,600 --> 0:09:15,440
that it's been flipped over in other

263
0:09:15,440 --> 0:09:18,320
words sine of minus x equals minus sine

264
0:09:18,320 --> 0:09:21,440
of x odd powers of x share that property

265
0:09:21,440 --> 0:09:23,839
but even powers don't and that's why

266
0:09:23,839 --> 0:09:25,760
there are no even powers of x in the

267
0:09:25,760 --> 0:09:27,920
taylor series for sine like i mentioned

268
0:09:27,920 --> 0:09
before oftentimes in physics we're not

269
0:09 --> 0:09:31,760
actually interested in the whole taylor

270
0:09:31,760 --> 0:09:33,839
series what we really want is a good

271
0:09:33,839 --> 0:09:36,160
approximation to a complicated function

272
0:09:36,160 --> 0:09:38,080
that makes a problem simpler to solve

273
0:09:38,080 --> 0:09:39,760
i'll show you examples of what i mean in

274
0:09:39,760 --> 0:09:41,920
a minute so in this case we might stop

275
0:09:41,920 --> 0:09:43,680
with the first term and just apply the

276
0:09:43,680 --> 0:09:45,920
fact that sine of x is approximately

277
0:09:45,920 --> 0:09:48,080
equal to x when x is small this is

278
0:09:48,080 --> 0:09:50,240
called the small angle approximation and

279
0:09:50,240 --> 0:09:51,600
you may have run into it in your first

280
0:09:51,600 --> 0:09:53,200
physics class when you learned about the

281
0:09:53,200 --> 0:09:55,519
simple pendulum the key point here is

282
0:09:55,519 --> 0:09:58,560
that when x is small like say 0.1 then

283
0:09:58,560 --> 0:10:00,640
when we take larger powers of x in the

284
0:10:00,640 --> 0:10:02,560
successive terms in the taylor series

285
0:10:02,560 --> 0:10:05,279
they get even smaller x cubed equals

286
0:10:05,279 --> 0:10:10,079
.001 x to the fifth equals .0001

287
0:10:10,079 --> 0:10
and so on not to mention the effect of

288
0:10 --> 0:10:14,640
the huge factorials in the denominators

289
0:10:14,640 --> 0:10:16,560
that's why we can ignore the higher

290
0:10:16,560 --> 0:10:18,720
order terms for small x and get a good

291
0:10:18,720 --> 0:10:20,480
approximation to our function just by

292
0:10:20,480 --> 0:10:22,480
keeping the leading term let's do one

293
0:10:22,480 --> 0:10:24,800
more quick example f of x equals e to

294
0:10:24,800 --> 0:10:26,959
the x this will be important in a moment

295
0:10:26,959 --> 0:10:28,480
for seeing the slickest way to write

296
0:10:28,480 --> 0:10:30,880
down taylor's formula this one's easy

297
0:10:30,880 --> 0:10:32,880
because the derivative of e to the x is

298
0:10:32,880 --> 0:10:34,880
just e to the x again and when we plug

299
0:10:34,880 --> 0:10:37,360
in x equals zero we get one and the

300
0:10:37,360 --> 0:10:40,079
coefficients are one over n factorial so

301
0:10:40,079 --> 0:10:41,680
we can just jump right to the taylor

302
0:10:41,680 --> 0:10:44,959
series e to the x equals one plus x plus

303
0:10:44,959 --> 0:10:47,279
one over two factorial x squared plus

304
0:10:47,279 --> 0:10:49,519
one over three factorial x cubed and so

305
0:10:49,519 --> 0:10:52,320
on and once again if x is tiny then we

306
0:10:52,320 --> 0:10:54,480
can get a good approximation by stopping

307
0:10:54,480 --> 0:10:56,320
at the linear term it's not quite as

308
0:10:56,320 --> 0:10:58,079
good as we had for sine of x though

309
0:10:58,079 --> 0:10:59,839
because in that case the x squared

310
0:10:59,839 --> 0:11:02,399
correction vanished now before we get to

311
0:11:02,399 --> 0:11:04,240
the physics examples the last thing i

312
0:11:04,240 --> 0:11:06,160
want to do is show you a few convenient

313
0:11:06,160 --> 0:11
ways of writing taylor's formula

314
0:11 --> 0:11:09,760
spelling out the whole sum like this

315
0:11:09,760 --> 0:11:12,160
obviously isn't very concise but we can

316
0:11:12,160 --> 0:11:14,240
write the same thing much more compactly

317
0:11:14,240 --> 0:11:17,040
using some notation the sum over n of

318
0:11:17,040 --> 0:11:19,519
one over n factorial the nth derivative

319
0:11:19,519 --> 0:11:22,800
of f evaluated at zero times x to the n

320
0:11:22,800 --> 0:11:25,200
this is the taylor series for f x

321
0:11:25,200 --> 0:11:27,680
expanded around x equals zero but come

322
0:11:27,680 --> 0:11:29,440
to think of it there was nothing special

323
0:11:29,440 --> 0:11:31,200
about x equals zero here that's just

324
0:11:31,200 --> 0:11:32,880
where we happened to put the origin when

325
0:11:32,880 --> 0:11:34,720
we drew the graph of f of x we could

326
0:11:34,720 --> 0:11:36,399
just as well write an expansion around

327
0:11:36,399 --> 0:11:39,200
any other point call it x zero say then

328
0:11:39,200 --> 0:11:42,079
the taylor expansion of f around x0 is

329
0:11:42,079 --> 0:11:44,399
given by the sum of one over n factorial

330
0:11:44,399 --> 0:11:46,800
times the derivatives of f evaluated at

331
0:11:46,800 --> 0:11:49,440
that starting point x0 times the powers

332
0:11:49,440 --> 0:11:52,320
of the distance from there x minus x0

333
0:11:52,320 --> 0:11:53,839
for example here's what we get with the

334
0:11:53,839 --> 0:11:55,760
first few terms of the taylor series for

335
0:11:55,760 --> 0:11:57,760
this function expanded around this given

336
0:11:57,760 --> 0:11:58,560
point

337
0:11:58,560 --> 0:12:00,079
actually there's another way of writing

338
0:12:00,079 --> 0:12:02,560
this expression that's often more useful

339
0:12:02,560 --> 0:12:04,240
let epsilon denote this quantity in

340
0:12:04,240 --> 0:12:07,120
parentheses x minus x0 it measures how

341
0:12:07,120 --> 0:12:08,959
far away you are from the starting point

342
0:12:08,959 --> 0:12:10,959
so when epsilon is small you're very

343
0:12:10,959 --> 0:12:13,040
close to x0 and as it gets bigger you

344
0:12:13,040 --> 0:12:16,240
get farther away then x is given by x0

345
0:12:16,240 --> 0:12:18,160
plus epsilon and we can write the same

346
0:12:18,160 --> 0:12:19,839
expression like this

347
0:12:19,839 --> 0:12:21,360
this way of writing things makes it

348
0:12:21,360 --> 0:12:22,880
really clear that we can think of the

349
0:12:22,880 --> 0:12:24,800
taylor series as starting at the point

350
0:12:24,800 --> 0:12:27,200
x0 and then expanding out away from

351
0:12:27,200 --> 0:12:30,720
there by evaluating f at x0 plus epsilon

352
0:12:30,720 --> 0:12:32,880
in powers of the displacement but this

353
0:12:32,880 --> 0:12:34,320
isn't even the slickest way to write the

354
0:12:34,320 --> 0:12:35,920
taylor series which is the formula i

355
0:12:35,920 --> 0:12:37,360
showed you at the very beginning of the

356
0:12:37,360 --> 0:12:39,600
video to see how that works we'll switch

357
0:12:39,600 --> 0:12:41,760
to the other notation for derivatives so

358
0:12:41,760 --> 0:12:44,240
the nth derivative of f is obtained by

359
0:12:44,240 --> 0:12:47,200
applying d by dx to it n times or in

360
0:12:47,200 --> 0:12:49,920
other words d by dx to the power n

361
0:12:49,920 --> 0:12:52,079
acting on f then we'll plug this into

362
0:12:52,079 --> 0:12:53,760
the taylor series which lets us write it

363
0:12:53,760 --> 0:12:55,680
like this i went ahead and dropped the

364
0:12:55,680 --> 0:12:57,760
x0 subscript now because that was just a

365
0:12:57,760 --> 0:13
label that we don't need anymore so far

366
0:13 --> 0:13:01,120
this doesn't look like a huge

367
0:13:01,120 --> 0:13:03,519
simplification but now let's drag that

368
0:13:03,519 --> 0:13:05,600
epsilon to the end to the left inside

369
0:13:05,600 --> 0:13:06,959
the parentheses

370
0:13:06,959 --> 0:13:08,959
now this looks really interesting it

371
0:13:08,959 --> 0:13:10,720
says that if we want to know the value

372
0:13:10,720 --> 0:13:12,560
of our function f at a point that's

373
0:13:12,560 --> 0:13:15,279
shifted away from x by an amount epsilon

374
0:13:15,279 --> 0:13:17,279
what we should do is take the function

375
0:13:17,279 --> 0:13:19,839
at the original point x and apply this

376
0:13:19,839 --> 0:13:22,480
special combination of derivatives to it

377
0:13:22,480 --> 0:13
but hang on a second that might look

378
0:13 --> 0:13:26,240
familiar remember from a minute ago that

379
0:13:26,240 --> 0:13:28,160
the taylor series we found for e to the

380
0:13:28,160 --> 0:13:30,959
z was one plus z plus one over two

381
0:13:30,959 --> 0:13:33,360
factorial z squared plus one over three

382
0:13:33,360 --> 0:13
factorial z cubed plus dot dot

383
0:13 --> 0:13:38,320
or in some notation the sum of one over

384
0:13:38,320 --> 0:13:40,720
n factorial z to the n but that's

385
0:13:40,720 --> 0:13:42,720
exactly what this differential operator

386
0:13:42,720 --> 0:13:44,399
looks like where z is this thing in

387
0:13:44,399 --> 0:13:47,279
parentheses epsilon d by dx then this

388
0:13:47,279 --> 0:13:49,920
big sum of derivatives is nothing but e

389
0:13:49,920 --> 0:13:52,880
to the epsilon d by d x and so at least

390
0:13:52,880 --> 0:13:55,279
formally we can write f of x plus

391
0:13:55,279 --> 0:13:58,399
epsilon equals e to the epsilon d by d x

392
0:13:58,399 --> 0:14:00,160
acting on f x

393
0:14:00,160 --> 0:14:02,639
this is the most compact convenient and

394
0:14:02,639 --> 0:14:04,079
beautiful way of writing taylor's

395
0:14:04,079 --> 0:14:06,880
formula it neatly repackages the whole

396
0:14:06,880 --> 0:14:09,199
infinite sum over derivatives of f and

397
0:14:09,199 --> 0:14:11,680
powers of the displacement into a single

398
0:14:11,680 --> 0:14:14,720
operator e to the epsilon d by dx acting

399
0:14:14,720 --> 0:14:16,720
on the function just to make sure it's

400
0:14:16,720 --> 0:14:18,639
clear how this works let's try applying

401
0:14:18,639 --> 0:14:20,720
it to a really simple function f of x

402
0:14:20,720 --> 0:14:23,440
equals mx plus b obviously the taylor

403
0:14:23,440 --> 0:14:24,800
series for this one is going to be

404
0:14:24,800 --> 0:14:26,800
really boring it already is its own

405
0:14:26,800 --> 0:14:28,639
taylor series we expand out the

406
0:14:28,639 --> 0:14:31,199
exponential and get one plus epsilon

407
0:14:31,199 --> 0:14:33,279
times the first derivative plus one half

408
0:14:33,279 --> 0:14:34,880
epsilon squared times the second

409
0:14:34,880 --> 0:14:36,880
derivative and so on and then all that

410
0:14:36,880 --> 0:14:39,440
acts on the function mx plus b when we

411
0:14:39,440 --> 0:14:42,160
multiply out the one we just get back mx

412
0:14:42,160 --> 0:14:44,079
plus b and when the first derivative

413
0:14:44,079 --> 0:14:46,959
term x we get epsilon m as for that

414
0:14:46,959 --> 0:14:49,040
second derivative and everything else

415
0:14:49,040 --> 0:14:50,800
all that disappears because when you

416
0:14:50,800 --> 0:14:52,320
take more than one derivative of a

417
0:14:52,320 --> 0:14:55,040
straight line you get zero so altogether

418
0:14:55,040 --> 0:14
we've got mx plus b plus epsilon m or

419
0:14 --> 0:15:00,880
equivalently m times x plus epsilon plus

420
0:15:00,880 --> 0:15:03,760
b which is precisely f of x plus epsilon

421
0:15:03,760 --> 0:15:05,199
just as expected

422
0:15:05,199 --> 0:15:06,959
one last beautiful thing about this way

423
0:15:06,959 --> 0:15:08,560
of writing taylor's formula before we

424
0:15:08,560 --> 0:15:10,079
get to the physics it makes the

425
0:15:10,079 --> 0:15:12,160
generalization to the multivariable

426
0:15:12,160 --> 0:15:14,320
taylor expansion really straightforward

427
0:15:14,320 --> 0:15:17,279
say we now have a function f of x y z

428
0:15:17,279 --> 0:15:19,199
for example this might be the potential

429
0:15:19,199 --> 0:15:20,959
energy function of a particle moving

430
0:15:20,959 --> 0:15:22,959
around in three dimensional space then

431
0:15:22,959 --> 0:15:25,440
what's the taylor expansion of this the

432
0:15:25,440 --> 0:15:27,360
most direct way to approach it is to

433
0:15:27,360 --> 0:15:29,600
expand like before with one variable at

434
0:15:29,600 --> 0:15:31,920
a time if we apply the taylor expansion

435
0:15:31,920 --> 0:15:34,880
just in x we get f of x still with y

436
0:15:34,880 --> 0:15:37,839
plus epsilon y z plus epsilon z plus

437
0:15:37,839 --> 0:15:40,800
epsilon x d by dx of that plus half

438
0:15:40,800 --> 0:15:42,800
epsilon x squared times the second

439
0:15:42,800 --> 0:15:45,120
derivative with respect to x and so on

440
0:15:45,120 --> 0:15:47,199
where these are now partial derivatives

441
0:15:47,199 --> 0:15:49,040
because f is a function of more than one

442
0:15:49,040 --> 0:15:51,120
variable all that means is that we take

443
0:15:51,120 --> 0:15:53,040
the derivative of f with respect to x

444
0:15:53,040 --> 0:15:54,639
like we normally would treating the

445
0:15:54,639 --> 0:15:57,600
other variables y and z as constants but

446
0:15:57,600 --> 0:15:59,759
now we have to do the same expansion

447
0:15:59,759 --> 0:16:02,560
over again in each of these terms for y

448
0:16:02,560 --> 0:16:04,639
and then again in each of those terms

449
0:16:04,639 --> 0:16:07,279
for z it's a bit of a mess but our

450
0:16:07,279 --> 0:16:09,279
exponential formula makes the whole

451
0:16:09,279 --> 0:16:11,759
thing incredibly simple let's write r

452
0:16:11,759 --> 0:16:14,240
vector equals x y z for the position

453
0:16:14,240 --> 0:16:16,800
vector and epsilon vector equals epsilon

454
0:16:16,800 --> 0:16:19,279
x epsilon y epsilon z for the

455
0:16:19,279 --> 0:16:21,600
displacement vector then we're trying to

456
0:16:21,600 --> 0:16:25,120
tailor expand f of r vector plus epsilon

457
0:16:25,120 --> 0:16:27,120
all we need to do to generalize our

458
0:16:27,120 --> 0:16:29,279
original formula is to replace the

459
0:16:29,279 --> 0:16:31,920
epsilon d by dx in the exponent with the

460
0:16:31,920 --> 0:16:34,480
dot product between epsilon vector and

461
0:16:34,480 --> 0:16:36,320
the quote-unquote vector of partial

462
0:16:36,320 --> 0:16:39,759
derivatives d by d x d by d y d by d z

463
0:16:39,759 --> 0:16:41,680
which is usually denoted by this upside

464
0:16:41,680 --> 0:16:44,639
down triangle called del and so this dot

465
0:16:44,639 --> 0:16:47,440
product just means epsilon x d by d x

466
0:16:47,440 --> 0:16:50,800
plus epsilon y d by d y plus epsilon z d

467
0:16:50,800 --> 0:16:53,519
by d z then by combining the exponential

468
0:16:53,519 --> 0:16
formulas for the taylor series in x y

469
0:16 --> 0:16:58,399
and z we get this beautiful compact

470
0:16:58,399 --> 0:17:00,160
formula for the taylor expansion in

471
0:17:00,160 --> 0:17:02,639
three or any number of variables

472
0:17:02,639 --> 0:17:04,959
okay that's enough math now let's put it

473
0:17:04,959 --> 0:17:07,679
to work with part two the physics i

474
0:17:07,679 --> 0:17:09,839
promised to show you three applications

475
0:17:09,839 --> 0:17:11,839
number one how to make the complicated

476
0:17:11,839 --> 0:17:13,760
equations that we often need to solve in

477
0:17:13,760 --> 0:17:16,160
physics simpler by studying special

478
0:17:16,160 --> 0:17:18,720
linearized limits number two the

479
0:17:18,720 --> 0:17:20,799
non-relativistic limit of einstein's

480
0:17:20,799 --> 0:17:23,120
energy formula and how it contributes to

481
0:17:23,120 --> 0:17:25,600
the fine structure of the hydrogen atom

482
0:17:25,600 --> 0:17:27,679
and number three the definition of the

483
0:17:27,679 --> 0:17:30,080
momentum operator in quantum mechanics

484
0:17:30,080 --> 0:17:32,240
let's go one by one again you don't

485
0:17:32,240 --> 0:17:33,919
necessarily need to know anything going

486
0:17:33,919 --> 0:17:36,080
in about relativity or quantum mechanics

487
0:17:36,080 --> 0:17:38,080
the point is just to get a taste of how

488
0:17:38,080 --> 0:17:40,400
taylor's formula appears in several very

489
0:17:40,400 --> 0:17:42,559
different areas of physics starting with

490
0:17:42,559 --> 0:17:44,720
number one making complicated problems

491
0:17:44,720 --> 0:17:46,960
simple the basic procedure to solve a

492
0:17:46,960 --> 0:17:48,799
problem in classical mechanics is to

493
0:17:48,799 --> 0:17:50,799
write down all the forces on a particle

494
0:17:50,799 --> 0:17:52,640
and then add them up and write f equals

495
0:17:52,640 --> 0:17:54,720
ma and then solve this equation for the

496
0:17:54,720 --> 0:17:56,400
position of the particle as a function

497
0:17:56,400 --> 0:17:58,480
of time that's easier said than done

498
0:17:58,480 --> 0:18:00,960
though especially the last step solving

499
0:18:00,960 --> 0:18:02,880
f equals m a because for all but the

500
0:18:02,880 --> 0:18:05,120
simplest systems this equation quickly

501
0:18:05,120 --> 0:18:07,919
becomes too hard to solve exactly f

502
0:18:07,919 --> 0:18:10,320
equals m a is a differential equation

503
0:18:10,320 --> 0:18:11,840
which just means that it contains

504
0:18:11,840 --> 0:18:13,520
derivatives of the function that you're

505
0:18:13,520 --> 0:18:16,240
trying to solve for r of t in this case

506
0:18:16,240 --> 0:18:18,080
and differential equations are much

507
0:18:18,080 --> 0:18:20,080
harder to solve than the algebraic

508
0:18:20,080 --> 0:18:22,160
equations that we all first learn about

509
0:18:22,160 --> 0:18:23,840
in middle school and high school a

510
0:18:23,840 --> 0:18:25,520
simple example that i've told you about

511
0:18:25,520 --> 0:18
in a few past videos is the pendulum

512
0:18 --> 0:18:29,360
when solving for the motion of a

513
0:18:29,360 --> 0:18:31,280
pendulum the main force we're interested

514
0:18:31,280 --> 0:18:33,200
in is the component of gravity that

515
0:18:33,200 --> 0:18:35,120
points along the tangent direction to

516
0:18:35,120 --> 0:18:36,720
the circle where the particle is

517
0:18:36,720 --> 0:18:39,440
constrained to move that's given by mg

518
0:18:39,440 --> 0:18:41,440
sine of theta where theta is the angle

519
0:18:41,440 --> 0:18:42,559
that the pendulum makes with the

520
0:18:42,559 --> 0:18:44,559
vertical axis like i showed you in the

521
0:18:44,559 --> 0:18:46,240
very first video i posted here on the

522
0:18:46,240 --> 0:18:48,400
channel then the f equals ma equation

523
0:18:48,400 --> 0:18:50,240
for theta can be written after a little

524
0:18:50,240 --> 0:18:52,240
simplifying as the second derivative of

525
0:18:52,240 --> 0:18:54,320
theta with respect to time equals minus

526
0:18:54,320 --> 0:18:57,120
g over l sine of theta simple as this

527
0:18:57,120 --> 0:18:59,280
physical setup looks this equation is

528
0:18:59,280 --> 0:19:01,440
already very complicated because of this

529
0:19:01,440 --> 0:19:03,600
factor of sine of theta it makes it what

530
0:19:03,600 --> 0:19:05,600
we call a non-linear differential

531
0:19:05,600 --> 0:19:07,600
equation which can be very nasty to try

532
0:19:07,600 --> 0:19:09,760
to solve on the other hand when theta is

533
0:19:09,760 --> 0:19:12,080
small you can picture a pendulum gently

534
0:19:12,080 --> 0:19:13,440
rocking back and forth like a

535
0:19:13,440 --> 0:19:15,200
grandfather clock and that motion

536
0:19:15,200 --> 0:19:17,200
certainly doesn't seem very complicated

537
0:19:17,200 --> 0:19:19,440
is it possible then that we can simplify

538
0:19:19,440 --> 0:19:21,440
this equation when theta is relatively

539
0:19:21,440 --> 0:19:24,080
small the taylor series lets us do just

540
0:19:24,080 --> 0:19:25,840
that like we worked out before the

541
0:19:25,840 --> 0:19:28,240
taylor series for sine is theta minus

542
0:19:28,240 --> 0:19:30,400
one over three factorial theta cubed

543
0:19:30,400 --> 0:19:32,320
plus one over five factorial theta to

544
0:19:32,320 --> 0:19:34,640
the fifth plus dot dot dot then for tiny

545
0:19:34,640 --> 0:19:36,640
thetas we can apply the small angle

546
0:19:36,640 --> 0:19:38,720
approximation like we saw before then

547
0:19:38,720 --> 0:19:41,039
this complicated f equals ma equation

548
0:19:41,039 --> 0:19:43,679
becomes vastly simpler there's no sine

549
0:19:43,679 --> 0:19:45,679
theta factor here anymore making this

550
0:19:45,679 --> 0:19:48,080
equation complicated and non-linear by

551
0:19:48,080 --> 0:19:49,840
applying the taylor series we've been

552
0:19:49,840 --> 0:19:51,840
able to linearize the differential

553
0:19:51,840 --> 0:19:53,679
equation to turn it into a problem we

554
0:19:53,679 --> 0:19:55,679
can solve much more easily in the

555
0:19:55,679 --> 0:19:57,840
special case when the pendulum isn't too

556
0:19:57,840 --> 0:20:00,080
far away from equilibrium this is just

557
0:20:00,080 --> 0:20:01,760
the equation of a simple harmonic

558
0:20:01,760 --> 0:20:03,919
oscillator now like a mass on a spring

559
0:20:03,919 --> 0:20:05,919
and the general solution is a sum of

560
0:20:05,919 --> 0:20:08,480
sines and cosines with angular frequency

561
0:20:08,480 --> 0:20:10,799
square root g over l so the pendulum

562
0:20:10,799 --> 0:20:12,799
indeed rocks gently back and forth from

563
0:20:12,799 --> 0:20:14,640
side to side if you've been watching my

564
0:20:14,640 --> 0:20:16,159
recent videos and all this looks

565
0:20:16,159 --> 0:20:18,559
familiar it's no accident i told you a

566
0:20:18,559 --> 0:20:20,559
few weeks ago about how the first thing

567
0:20:20,559 --> 0:20:22,720
we should do in any physics problem is

568
0:20:22,720 --> 0:20:24,799
expand the potential energy function

569
0:20:24,799 --> 0:20:26,960
around a stable equilibrium point in a

570
0:20:26,960 --> 0:20:29,840
taylor series u of x equals u of zero

571
0:20:29,840 --> 0:20:32,799
plus u prime of zero times x plus half u

572
0:20:32,799 --> 0:20:35,200
double prime of zero x squared plus dot

573
0:20:35,200 --> 0:20:37,200
dot where i chose my coordinates here so

574
0:20:37,200 --> 0:20:38,960
that the equilibrium point is at x

575
0:20:38,960 --> 0:20:41,360
equals zero the first term u of zero is

576
0:20:41,360 --> 0:20:43,120
just a constant and that doesn't matter

577
0:20:43,120 --> 0:20:44,880
you're always allowed to change what you

578
0:20:44,880 --> 0:20:46,960
call the ground level of your potential

579
0:20:46,960 --> 0:20:48,880
energy function and shift this constant

580
0:20:48,880 --> 0:20:51,600
away the second term meanwhile vanishes

581
0:20:51,600 --> 0:20:53,760
because we've chosen to expand around a

582
0:20:53,760 --> 0:20:55,600
minimum of the potential where u prime

583
0:20:55,600 --> 0:20
is equal to zero so typically the first

584
0:20 --> 0:20:59,919
interesting term in the taylor expansion

585
0:20:59,919 --> 0:21:02,080
of a potential around equilibrium is the

586
0:21:02,080 --> 0:21:04,080
quadratic term which is just like the

587
0:21:04,080 --> 0:21:06,720
potential energy one half kx squared of

588
0:21:06,720 --> 0:21:09,280
a block on a spring this is why systems

589
0:21:09,280 --> 0:21:11,280
oscillate back and forth around their

590
0:21:11,280 --> 0:21:13,120
equilibrium position i'll put a link in

591
0:21:13,120 --> 0:21:14,400
the description to the video where i

592
0:21:14,400 --> 0:21:16,799
talked all about this as for the force

593
0:21:16,799 --> 0:21:18,559
that's related to the potential energy

594
0:21:18,559 --> 0:21:21,200
by f equals minus to u by dx and

595
0:21:21,200 --> 0:21:22,960
therefore the taylor series for the

596
0:21:22,960 --> 0:21:25,120
force on a particle near equilibrium

597
0:21:25,120 --> 0:21:27,520
starts with f equals minus u double

598
0:21:27,520 --> 0:21:30,559
prime of zero times x again just like

599
0:21:30,559 --> 0:21:33,120
the spring force minus kx

600
0:21:33,120 --> 0:21:36,480
in particular the force is linear so the

601
0:21:36,480 --> 0:21:38,400
trick i taught you a couple of weeks ago

602
0:21:38,400 --> 0:21:40,080
about the simple harmonic motion you

603
0:21:40,080 --> 0:21:42,240
discover when you expand the potential

604
0:21:42,240 --> 0:21:44,559
energy around a stable equilibrium is

605
0:21:44,559 --> 0:21:47,280
secretly the same thing as linearizing

606
0:21:47,280 --> 0:21:49,360
the f equals ma equation

607
0:21:49,360 --> 0:21:51,360
next up let's look at the newtonian

608
0:21:51,360 --> 0:21:53,440
limit of einstein's theory of special

609
0:21:53,440 --> 0:21:56,240
relativity in newtonian mechanics a free

610
0:21:56,240 --> 0:21:58,880
particle has kinetic energy one-half mv

611
0:21:58,880 --> 0:22:01,039
squared alternatively if we plug in the

612
0:22:01,039 --> 0:22:03,280
momentum p equals mv we can write the

613
0:22:03,280 --> 0:22:06,480
same thing as p squared over 2m

614
0:22:06,480 --> 0:22:08,880
this is the energy of a non-relativistic

615
0:22:08,880 --> 0:22:11,159
free particle with momentum p

616
0:22:11,159 --> 0:22:13,440
non-relativistic means that the particle

617
0:22:13,440 --> 0:22:15,280
isn't moving very fast compared to the

618
0:22:15,280 --> 0:22:17,120
speed of light when particles do

619
0:22:17,120 --> 0:22:18,960
approach the speed of light some weird

620
0:22:18,960 --> 0:22:20,480
and wild things happen that were

621
0:22:20,480 --> 0:22:22,400
discovered by einstein 100 and some

622
0:22:22,400 --> 0:22:24,320
years ago when he wrote down his special

623
0:22:24,320 --> 0:22:26,080
theory of relativity in special

624
0:22:26,080 --> 0:22:28,480
relativity the energy of a free particle

625
0:22:28,480 --> 0:22:30,960
of mass m and momentum p is given by

626
0:22:30,960 --> 0:22:33,520
this new formula the square root of m

627
0:22:33,520 --> 0:22:36,080
squared c to the four plus p squared c

628
0:22:36,080 --> 0:22:38,240
squared where c is the speed of light

629
0:22:38,240 --> 0:22:39,760
you've seen this before even if you've

630
0:22:39,760 --> 0:22:41,840
never studied special relativity because

631
0:22:41,840 --> 0:22:43,919
if the particle is at rest so that p

632
0:22:43,919 --> 0:22:47,039
equals zero we get e equals m c squared

633
0:22:47,039 --> 0:22:48,799
which might be the most famous equation

634
0:22:48,799 --> 0:22:50,720
in physics but when the particle is

635
0:22:50,720 --> 0:22:53,120
moving we need this more general formula

636
0:22:53,120 --> 0:22:54,559
including the contribution from the

637
0:22:54,559 --> 0:22:57,039
momentum this formula holds even if the

638
0:22:57,039 --> 0:22:58,799
speed of the particle approaches the

639
0:22:58,799 --> 0:23:01,120
speed of light but on the other hand we

640
0:23:01,120 --> 0:23:02,960
know what the energy is supposed to be

641
0:23:02,960 --> 0:23:05,440
when p is small so how do we see that

642
0:23:05,440 --> 0:23:07,679
einstein's formula correctly reproduces

643
0:23:07,679 --> 0:23:09,360
newton's formula for a slow moving

644
0:23:09,360 --> 0:23
particle the idea is of course to apply

645
0:23 --> 0:23:13,919
the taylor expansion of einstein's

646
0:23:13,919 --> 0:23:16,080
energy when p is small let's first of

647
0:23:16,080 --> 0:23:18,080
all pull this factor of m squared c to

648
0:23:18,080 --> 0:23
the 4 outside the square root then we

649
0:23 --> 0:23:21,679
can write the whole thing like this this

650
0:23:21,679 --> 0:23:23,360
makes it clear that what we want to do

651
0:23:23,360 --> 0:23:25,679
here is compute the taylor series for f

652
0:23:25,679 --> 0:23:29,039
of x equals 1 plus x square root when x

653
0:23:29,039 --> 0:23:31,039
equals p squared over m squared c

654
0:23:31,039 --> 0:23:33,360
squared is small actually this kind of

655
0:23:33,360 --> 0:23:35,280
taylor series shows up so often in

656
0:23:35,280 --> 0:23:36,960
physics that it's worth writing down the

657
0:23:36,960 --> 0:23:39,200
slightly more general case for f of x

658
0:23:39,200 --> 0:23:41,919
equals one plus x to some power q our

659
0:23:41,919 --> 0:23:43,440
current case with the square root would

660
0:23:43,440 --> 0:23:45,679
be q equals half i'll let you work out

661
0:23:45,679 --> 0:23:47,200
the first few terms of this taylor

662
0:23:47,200 --> 0:23:49,200
series for yourself for practice i also

663
0:23:49,200 --> 0:23:51,039
go through the details in the notes i

664
0:23:51,039 --> 0:23:54,960
get f of x equals one plus q x plus half

665
0:23:54,960 --> 0:23:58,080
q q minus one times x squared the first

666
0:23:58,080 --> 0:24:00,159
pair of terms here is again a very

667
0:24:00,159 --> 0:24:02,400
useful approximation that comes up a lot

668
0:24:02,400 --> 0:24:04,880
in physics now back to the relativistic

669
0:24:04,880 --> 0:24:07,760
energy we just plug in q equals half and

670
0:24:07,760 --> 0:24
x equals p squared over m squared c

671
0:24 --> 0:24:12,080
squared then here's what we get and if

672
0:24:12,080 --> 0:24:14,240
we multiply through by the m c squared

673
0:24:14,240 --> 0:24:16,720
here's where we end up e equals m c

674
0:24:16,720 --> 0:24:19,520
squared plus p squared over two m minus

675
0:24:19,520 --> 0:24:21,760
p to the four over eight m cubed c

676
0:24:21,760 --> 0:24:24,480
squared plus the higher powers of p the

677
0:24:24,480 --> 0:24:27,039
first term is e equals m c squared again

678
0:24:27,039 --> 0:24:28,799
that's what we get by evaluating the

679
0:24:28,799 --> 0:24:30,480
energy of a particle at rest and

680
0:24:30,480 --> 0:24:32,320
relativity it doesn't have a direct

681
0:24:32,320 --> 0:24:34,559
analog in newtonian mechanics but on the

682
0:24:34,559 --> 0:24:36,320
other hand it's just a constant and

683
0:24:36,320 --> 0:24:37,919
you're always free to add a constant to

684
0:24:37,919 --> 0:24:39,840
the total energy in newtonian mechanics

685
0:24:39,840 --> 0:24:41,919
without changing anything as for the

686
0:24:41,919 --> 0:24
second term there we see how the taylor

687
0:24 --> 0:24:46,640
series reproduces precisely the kinetic

688
0:24:46,640 --> 0:24:48,480
energy that we expect in newtonian

689
0:24:48,480 --> 0:24:50,559
mechanics actually i'm being slightly

690
0:24:50,559 --> 0:24:52,320
sloppy here because the definition of

691
0:24:52,320 --> 0:24:54,720
the momentum p actually gets modified in

692
0:24:54,720 --> 0:24:56,559
relativity and we should really tailor

693
0:24:56,559 --> 0:24:58,400
expand that as well but in the

694
0:24:58,400 --> 0:25:00,400
non-relativistic limit we of course get

695
0:25:00,400 --> 0:25:03,520
back the newtonian momentum p equals mv

696
0:25:03,520 --> 0:25:05,039
but what about this next term in the

697
0:25:05,039 --> 0:25:06,640
taylor series that goes like p to the

698
0:25:06,640 --> 0:25:08,080
four what are we supposed to make of

699
0:25:08,080 --> 0:25:11,039
that the point is newtonian mechanics is

700
0:25:11,039 --> 0:25:12,799
a good description of the world for

701
0:25:12,799 --> 0:25:14,640
particles that aren't moving anywhere

702
0:25:14,640 --> 0:25:16,400
close to the speed of light but it's

703
0:25:16,400 --> 0:25:18,960
only an approximation this next term in

704
0:25:18,960 --> 0:25:20,960
the taylor expansion is the leading

705
0:25:20,960 --> 0:25:23,360
relativistic correction to the newtonian

706
0:25:23,360 --> 0:25:25,760
energy when the speed is tiny compared

707
0:25:25,760 --> 0:25:27,120
to the speed of light and this

708
0:25:27,120 --> 0:25:28,960
additional term gives a very small

709
0:25:28,960 --> 0:25:30,799
correction to newton's result and we can

710
0:25:30,799 --> 0:25:32,799
ignore it without losing much accuracy

711
0:25:32,799 --> 0:25:34,640
but as the speed gets larger this

712
0:25:34,640 --> 0:25:36,240
correction becomes increasingly

713
0:25:36,240 --> 0:25:38,159
important one place we can see this

714
0:25:38,159 --> 0:25:40,320
correction in action is in the binding

715
0:25:40,320 --> 0:25:42,320
energy of a hydrogen atom that's the

716
0:25:42,320 --> 0:25:44,320
amount of energy you would need to kick

717
0:25:44,320 --> 0:25:46,320
the electron out of its quote-unquote

718
0:25:46,320 --> 0:25:48,400
orbit around the proton at the center of

719
0:25:48,400 --> 0:25:50,240
the atom in a video from a couple of

720
0:25:50,240 --> 0:25:52,240
months ago i showed you how we can get

721
0:25:52,240 --> 0:25:54,240
90 percent of the way to the answer for

722
0:25:54,240 --> 0:25:56,400
the binding energy just by applying

723
0:25:56,400 --> 0:25:58,799
dimensional analysis in other words by

724
0:25:58,799 --> 0:26:00,880
making a list of the parameters we have

725
0:26:00,880 --> 0:26:02,880
available to play with and their units

726
0:26:02,880 --> 0:26:05,039
and seeing how we can combine them to

727
0:26:05,039 --> 0:26:06,559
get something with the units that we

728
0:26:06,559 --> 0:26:08,640
want in this case we saw that we can

729
0:26:08,640 --> 0:26:11,600
combine the electron mass m in kilograms

730
0:26:11,600 --> 0:26
its electric charge e in coulombs

731
0:26 --> 0:26:16,240
coulomb's constant k which sets the

732
0:26:16,240 --> 0:26:17,919
strength of the electric force in

733
0:26:17,919 --> 0:26:19,840
newton's meters squared per coulomb

734
0:26:19,840 --> 0:26:22,080
squared and planck's constant h-bar

735
0:26:22,080 --> 0:26:23,279
which sets the scale of quantum

736
0:26:23,279 --> 0:26:25,440
mechanics in kilograms meters squared

737
0:26:25,440 --> 0:26:27,760
per second to get units of energy like

738
0:26:27,760 --> 0:26:29,919
so then the binding energy of the

739
0:26:29,919 --> 0:26:32,320
hydrogen atom must be proportional to

740
0:26:32,320 --> 0:26:34,559
this just by thinking about the units

741
0:26:34,559 --> 0:26:36,799
like this gets us almost all the way to

742
0:26:36,799 --> 0:26:39,120
the answer the actual formula for the

743
0:26:39,120 --> 0:26:41,039
binding energy comes with a factor of

744
0:26:41,039 --> 0:26:42,960
half though which we can't get by only

745
0:26:42,960 --> 0:26:44,799
thinking about the units because 2

746
0:26:44,799 --> 0:26:47,360
doesn't have any units this is bohr's

747
0:26:47,360 --> 0:26:48,960
formula for the binding energy of

748
0:26:48,960 --> 0:26:50,720
hydrogen and it was one of the first

749
0:26:50,720 --> 0:26:52,080
great accomplishments of quantum

750
0:26:52,080 --> 0:26:55,600
mechanics its numerical value about 13.6

751
0:26:55,600 --> 0:26:57,760
electron volts matches very closely to

752
0:26:57,760 --> 0:26:59,600
the experimental value of the binding

753
0:26:59,600 --> 0:27:02,159
energy and yet bohr's formula is only an

754
0:27:02,159 --> 0:27:04,720
approximation it neglects the small but

755
0:27:04,720 --> 0:27:06,400
fascinating and experimentally

756
0:27:06,400 --> 0:27:08,720
observable effects of special relativity

757
0:27:08,720 --> 0:27:10,080
but where do we go wrong in our

758
0:27:10,080 --> 0:27:12,080
dimensional analysis argument we wrote

759
0:27:12,080 --> 0:27:15,279
down the only possible way to combine m

760
0:27:15,279 --> 0:27:18,480
e k and h bar to make units of energy

761
0:27:18,480 --> 0:27:20,880
well it's not that we went wrong per se

762
0:27:20,880 --> 0:27:22,399
it's that in writing down the

763
0:27:22,399 --> 0:27:24,399
non-relativistic approximation to the

764
0:27:24,399 --> 0:27:26,559
binding energy we omitted the speed of

765
0:27:26,559 --> 0:27:29,200
light c from our list of parameters so

766
0:27:29,200 --> 0:27:30,640
if we want to include the effects of

767
0:27:30,640 --> 0:27:32,640
special relativity we need to consider

768
0:27:32,640 --> 0:27:34,559
how c can enter the formula for the

769
0:27:34,559 --> 0:27:37,120
energy but something remarkable happens

770
0:27:37,120 --> 0:27:39,360
when we add c to the list of parameters

771
0:27:39,360 --> 0:27:41,679
we can form a dimensionless combination

772
0:27:41,679 --> 0:27:45,279
by alpha equals ke squared over h bar c

773
0:27:45,279 --> 0:27:47,120
this combination is called the fine

774
0:27:47,120 --> 0:27:48,960
structure constant i'll leave it for you

775
0:27:48,960 --> 0:27:50,640
to check that all the dimensions really

776
0:27:50,640 --> 0:27:52,399
do cancel out here when you plug in the

777
0:27:52,399 --> 0:27:54,320
units if you put in the numbers you'll

778
0:27:54,320 --> 0:27:57,760
find that alpha is about .0073

779
0:27:57,760 --> 0:27:59,840
or a little more memorably about one

780
0:27:59,840 --> 0:28
divided by 137

781
0:28 --> 0:28
since alpha is unitless dimensional

782
0:28 --> 0:28:06,159
analysis doesn't tell us anything about

783
0:28:06,159 --> 0:28:07,840
how it appears in the formula for the

784
0:28:07,840 --> 0:28:09,520
energy no more than it could tell us

785
0:28:09,520 --> 0:28:11,840
about the factor of 2 in the denominator

786
0:28:11,840 --> 0:28:13,919
any function of alpha can multiply our

787
0:28:13,919 --> 0:28:15,600
expression for the energy without

788
0:28:15,600 --> 0:28:17,520
spoiling the units this is how

789
0:28:17,520 --> 0:28:19,679
relativity allows small corrections to

790
0:28:19,679 --> 0:28:22,320
bohr's formula which remember was itself

791
0:28:22,320 --> 0:28:24,559
already an excellent approximation to

792
0:28:24,559 --> 0:28:26,480
the experimental value of the hydrogen

793
0:28:26,480 --> 0:28:28,720
binding energy but we can get an even

794
0:28:28,720 --> 0:28:30,480
better theoretical prediction by

795
0:28:30,480 --> 0:28:32,720
considering the relativistic corrections

796
0:28:32,720 --> 0:28:34,159
with that leading relativistic

797
0:28:34,159 --> 0:28:36,240
correction that we derived by applying

798
0:28:36,240 --> 0:28:38,159
the taylor series to einstein's formula

799
0:28:38,159 --> 0:28:40,320
we can determine the small modification

800
0:28:40,320 --> 0:28:42,559
that relativity makes to bohr's formula

801
0:28:42,559 --> 0:28:44,559
the details require quantum mechanics so

802
0:28:44,559 --> 0:28:46,640
i won't go into that here but the result

803
0:28:46,640 --> 0:28:49,200
is that this function f is given by 1.

804
0:28:49,200 --> 0:28:50,960
that was for the original bohr answer

805
0:28:50,960 --> 0:28
plus 5 4 alpha squared remember that

806
0:28 --> 0:28:55,600
alpha is a tiny number so this

807
0:28:55,600 --> 0:28:57,760
correction that goes like alpha squared

808
0:28:57,760 --> 0:29
is even tinier still it's therefore

809
0:29 --> 0:29
called a fine structure correction to

810
0:29 --> 0:29:03,760
the energy there are in fact further

811
0:29:03,760 --> 0:29:05,520
corrections to this formula both at

812
0:29:05,520 --> 0:29:07,360
order alpha squared as well as even

813
0:29:07,360 --> 0:29:09,279
smaller corrections at higher orders in

814
0:29:09,279 --> 0:29:11,600
alpha from various physical effects

815
0:29:11,600 --> 0:29:13,200
finally while we're on the subject of

816
0:29:13,200 --> 0:29:15,279
quantum mechanics let's finish by seeing

817
0:29:15,279 --> 0:29:17,279
how taylor's formula is related to the

818
0:29:17,279 --> 0:29:19,200
definition of momentum in quantum

819
0:29:19,200 --> 0:29:21,520
mechanics in classical mechanics the

820
0:29:21,520 --> 0:29:23,120
main question is to solve for the

821
0:29:23,120 --> 0:29:25,520
trajectory x of t of a particle as a

822
0:29:25,520 --> 0:29:27,679
function of time in quantum mechanics on

823
0:29:27,679 --> 0:29:29,600
the other hand the goal is to find the

824
0:29:29,600 --> 0:29:31,919
wave function psi of x and how it

825
0:29:31,919 --> 0:29:33,840
evolves with time wherever the wave

826
0:29:33,840 --> 0:29:36,159
function or rather its square is bigger

827
0:29:36,159 --> 0:29:37,679
the more likely you are to find the

828
0:29:37,679 --> 0:29:39,520
particle at that location when you make

829
0:29:39,520 --> 0:29:41,039
a measurement those things that we

830
0:29:41,039 --> 0:29:42,799
measure about the particle like its

831
0:29:42,799 --> 0:29:45,279
position and momentum are represented by

832
0:29:45,279 --> 0:29:47,600
operators that act on the wave function

833
0:29:47,600 --> 0:29:49,520
we write x hat for the operator that

834
0:29:49,520 --> 0:29:51,600
measures the position and p-hat for the

835
0:29:51,600 --> 0:29:53,360
operator that measures the momentum the

836
0:29:53,360 --> 0:29:54,720
point of this video isn't to learn

837
0:29:54,720 --> 0:29:56,559
quantum mechanics right now but i gave

838
0:29:56,559 --> 0:29:58,320
you a bit of a crash course in the video

839
0:29:58,320 --> 0:30
i posted about symmetries in quantum

840
0:30 --> 0:30:01,120
mechanics that i'll link in the

841
0:30:01,120 --> 0:30:02,960
description if you want to see more i

842
0:30:02,960 --> 0:30:04,799
told you there about how the momentum

843
0:30:04,799 --> 0:30:06,559
operator is closely related to

844
0:30:06,559 --> 0:30:09,520
translations in space so let's define an

845
0:30:09,520 --> 0:30:11,760
operator call it u of epsilon that

846
0:30:11,760 --> 0:30:14,320
shifts the wave function over by epsilon

847
0:30:14,320 --> 0:30
if you haven't seen those earlier videos

848
0:30 --> 0:30:17,440
where i explained more about what all

849
0:30:17,440 --> 0:30:19,279
this means don't sweat it right now

850
0:30:19,279 --> 0:30:21,200
we'll just take this as a definition and

851
0:30:21,200 --> 0:30:23,039
discover how it's related to taylor's

852
0:30:23,039 --> 0:30:25,200
formula and indeed this looks familiar

853
0:30:25,200 --> 0:30:27,520
physics aside psi of x is just a

854
0:30:27,520 --> 0:30:29,600
function and this formula tells us that

855
0:30:29,600 --> 0:30:31,200
we're looking for an operator that

856
0:30:31,200 --> 0:30:34,159
shifts psi of x over to psi of x minus

857
0:30:34,159 --> 0:30:36,399
epsilon and that's exactly what taylor's

858
0:30:36,399 --> 0:30:37,600
formula does

859
0:30:37,600 --> 0:30:39,520
therefore we identify the translation

860
0:30:39,520 --> 0:30:42,399
operator u with e to the minus epsilon d

861
0:30:42,399 --> 0:30:44,720
by dx for reasons we won't delve into

862
0:30:44,720 --> 0:30:47,200
right now this translation operator u is

863
0:30:47,200 --> 0:30:49,520
related to the momentum operator by u of

864
0:30:49,520 --> 0:30:52,480
epsilon equals e to the minus i over h

865
0:30:52,480 --> 0:30:55,520
bar epsilon times p and comparing the

866
0:30:55,520 --> 0:30:57,919
two sides taylor's formula shows us that

867
0:30:57,919 --> 0:30:59,919
we should identify the momentum operator

868
0:30:59,919 --> 0:31:02,640
in quantum mechanics with p equals h bar

869
0:31:02,640 --> 0:31:05,440
over i d by dx when you do start

870
0:31:05,440 --> 0:31:07,120
studying quantum mechanics this will be

871
0:31:07,120 --> 0:31:08,960
one of the first formulas you'll learn

872
0:31:08,960 --> 0:31:10,960
it follows directly from taylor's

873
0:31:10,960 --> 0:31:11,919
formula

874
0:31:11,919 --> 0:31:13,919
this has been just a small selection of

875
0:31:13,919 --> 0:31:15,600
physics applications where taylor's

876
0:31:15,600 --> 0:31:17,919
formula shows up but again you'd really

877
0:31:17,919 --> 0:31:20,399
be hard-pressed to find any chapter of

878
0:31:20,399 --> 0:31:22,080
any physics textbook where it isn't

879
0:31:22,080 --> 0:31:24,320
applied keep your eyes open and you'll

880
0:31:24,320 --> 0:31:26,640
see taylor's formula everywhere you can

881
0:31:26,640 --> 0:31:28,399
