2
0:00:15,619 --> 0:00:18,119
hey guys I'm the hack Smith and on this

3
0:00:18,119 --> 0:00:19,650
episode make it real we're gonna try and

4
0:00:19,650 --> 0:00:21,480
make a real arc reactor since it's been

5
0:00:21,480 --> 0:00:27,470
one of your most common requests

6
0:00:27,470 --> 0:00:31,050
so what exactly is an arc reactor well

7
0:00:31,050 --> 0:00:32,880
it was first introduced to the MCU in

8
0:00:32,880 --> 0:00:35,160
iron man and just looking at it it looks

9
0:00:35,160 --> 0:00:37,050
like it produces a continual arc of

10
0:00:37,050 --> 0:00:39,720
electricity in a loop and somehow that

11
0:00:39,720 --> 0:00:42,900
generates power in the footage now to me

12
0:00:42,900 --> 0:00:44,580
it kind of looks like a perpetual energy

13
0:00:44,580 --> 0:00:47,400
device which we know is impossible

14
0:00:47,400 --> 0:00:49,200
because the most fundamental law of

15
0:00:49,200 --> 0:00:50,700
physics is a conservation of energy

16
0:00:50,700 --> 0:00:52,739
which states that energy in a closed

17
0:00:52,739 --> 0:00:54,540
system is constant which means energy

18
0:00:54,540 --> 0:00:58,020
cannot be created only transformed that

19
0:00:58,020 --> 0:01:00,180
simplifies into an equation energy N

20
0:01:00,180 --> 0:01:02,879
equals energy out plus losses usually in

21
0:01:02,879 --> 0:01:04,800
the form of heat because of the second

22
0:01:04,800 --> 0:01:06,360
law of thermodynamics we know there are

23
0:01:06,360 --> 0:01:09,030
always losses always which kind of makes

24
0:01:09,030 --> 0:01:11,490
sense when Obadiah says this the arc

25
0:01:11,490 --> 0:01:20,250
reactor that's a publicity stunt shut

26
0:01:20,250 --> 0:01:22,620
the hippies up it works yeah as a

27
0:01:22,620 --> 0:01:25,890
science project but then in the cave

28
0:01:25,890 --> 0:01:27,570
when Toni miniaturized the arc reactor

29
0:01:27,570 --> 0:01:30,180
uses palladium what is that

30
0:01:30,180 --> 0:01:33,240
that's palladium 0.15 grams which

31
0:01:33,240 --> 0:01:34,799
suggests the arc reactor might actually

32
0:01:34,799 --> 0:01:36,659
be nuclear technology since some

33
0:01:36,659 --> 0:01:39,180
palladium is radioactive unfortunately

34
0:01:39,180 --> 0:01:41,579
it's also highly carcinogenic and toxic

35
0:01:41,579 --> 0:01:43,289
so I'm not about to play with the lady

36
0:01:43,289 --> 0:01:46,259
'm for a fictional technology now the

37
0:01:46,259 --> 0:01:48,719
power output specified is also kind of

38
0:01:48,719 --> 0:01:52,049
ridiculous could you generate if my math

39
0:01:52,049 --> 0:01:54,869
is right I know it is three gigajoules

40
0:01:54,869 --> 0:01:57,810
per second a Joule per second is just a

41
0:01:57,810 --> 0:01:59,880
fancy scientific way of saying a single

42
0:01:59,880 --> 0:02:01,380
watt which means the arc reactor

43
0:02:01,380 --> 0:02:04,079
produces three gigawatts of power that's

44
0:02:04,079 --> 0:02:06,060
almost three times the power output of a

45
0:02:06,060 --> 0:02:07,649
time-travelling DeLorean from Back to

46
0:02:07,649 --> 0:02:16,320
the Future in fact if we were to sell

47
0:02:16,320 --> 0:02:17,970
that energy back to the power grid the

48
0:02:17,970 --> 0:02:20,100
same way I sell solar energy for my roof

49
0:02:20,100 --> 0:02:22,470
it would be the equivalent of 833

50
0:02:22,470 --> 0:02:24,630
kilowatt hours which will generate two

51
0:02:24,630 --> 0:02:26,400
hundred and fifty dollars per second of

52
0:02:26,400 --> 0:02:28,500
income or twenty one point six million

53
0:02:28,500 --> 0:02:31,350
dollars per day basically if I were to

54
0:02:31,350 --> 0:02:32,910
invent a real working Eric reactor all

55
0:02:32,910 --> 0:02:34,470
of our funding issues would be solved

56
0:02:34,470 --> 0:02:36,330
and we'd be well on our way to building

57
0:02:36,330 --> 0:02:36,840
a real life

58
0:02:36,840 --> 0:02:39,540
iron man suit or more realistically our

59
0:02:39,540 --> 0:02:41,310
entire company would be assassinated by

60
0:02:41,310 --> 0:02:43,680
the big oil companies so it's pretty

61
0:02:43,680 --> 0:02:45,180
much impossible to make a real working

62
0:02:45,180 --> 0:02:47,640
hour crow actor so let's build a real

63
0:02:47,640 --> 0:02:49,590
working hour Cree actor all right now

64
0:02:49,590 --> 0:02:51,090
before we build the art corrector let's

65
0:02:51,090 --> 0:02:52,680
take a look at a 3d model using some

66
0:02:52,680 --> 0:02:54,599
augmented reality tech not unlike tony

67
0:02:54,599 --> 0:02:58,440
stark himself pretty cool right let's

68
0:02:58,440 --> 0:03:04,230
take a closer look now it looks like the

69
0:03:04,230 --> 0:03:05,849
electricity is being generated in the

70
0:03:05,849 --> 0:03:08,099
final ring of the assembly but I guess

71
0:03:08,099 --> 0:03:09,329
the real question is if we're building

72
0:03:09,329 --> 0:03:11,160
an arc reactor how are we gonna do that

73
0:03:11,160 --> 0:03:13,319
let's get some paper out and actually do

74
0:03:13,319 --> 0:03:31,049
some calculations by hand so to sustain

75
0:03:31,049 --> 0:03
an arc of electricity around the arc

76
0:03 --> 0:03:34,590
reactor we're gonna need a lot of

77
0:03:34,590 --> 0:03:36,480
voltage but I am during the arc reactor

78
0:03:36,480 --> 0:03:38,819
is around 75 millimeters across which

79
0:03:38,819 --> 0:03:40,650
gives us a circumference of around 2 or

80
0:03:40,650 --> 0:03:42,959
41 millimeters which would be the path

81
0:03:42,959 --> 0:03:45,420
electricity actually has to follow now

82
0:03:45,420 --> 0:03:46,889
it takes approximately three million

83
0:03:46,889 --> 0:03:49,290
volts to ionize air for an arc to form

84
0:03:49,290 --> 0:03:51,720
across a distance of 1 meter at roughly

85
0:03:51,720 --> 0:03:55,019
30,000 volts per centimeter so with the

86
0:03:55,019 --> 0:03:57,180
24 point one centimeter travel path

87
0:03:57,180 --> 0:04:00,510
we'll need approximately 720 3900 volts

88
0:04:00,510 --> 0:04:02,670
of electricity luckily we have these

89
0:04:02,670 --> 0:04:04,319
little high voltage transformers which

90
0:04:04,319 --> 0:04:06,750
produce about 80,000 volts each there's

91
0:04:06,750 --> 0:04:09,209
ten segments in the arc reactor so that

92
0:04:09,209 --> 0:04:11,310
would be about eight hearts this might

93
0:04:11,310 --> 0:04:24,590
actually work let's start assembling it

94
0:04:24,590 --> 0:04:29,470
[Music]

95
0:04:29,470 --> 0:04:31,270
they do need to be close together so I

96
0:04:31,270 --> 0:04:35,750
might sicken up that divider wall yeah

97
0:04:35,750 --> 0:04:40,340
[Music]

98
0:04:40,340 --> 0:04:43,350
smells nice yeah I don't know what that

99
0:04:43,350 --> 0:04:49,350
I think it might be acrylic but most

100
0:04:49,350 --> 0:04:51,380
realistic arc reactor ever

101
0:04:51,380 --> 0:04:55,879
[Music]

102
0:04:55,879 --> 0:05:00,469
yeah so these wires you're not very sick

103
0:05:00,469 --> 0:05:01,999
but like if they're next to each other

104
0:05:01,999 --> 0:05:04,339
they don't arc as long as there's

105
0:05:04,339 --> 0:05:06,259
something else there so I'm wondering

106
0:05:06,259 --> 0:05:08,509
how thick the wires I need carrying the

107
0:05:08,509 --> 0:05:15,379
high voltage near my body safely safe as

108
0:05:15,379 --> 0:05:16,819
long as you don't become the path of

109
0:05:16,819 --> 0:05:21,590
least resistance would be fine

110
0:05:21,590 --> 0:05:34,970
[Music]

111
0:05:34,970 --> 0:05:45,830
[Music]

112
0:05:45,830 --> 0:05:48,569
[Music]

113
0:05:48,569 --> 0:05:50,469
all right now that we have mostly

114
0:05:50,469 --> 0:05:51,879
components assembled we're gonna have to

115
0:05:51,879 --> 0:05:54,490
control them somehow I made a quick

116
0:05:54,490 --> 0:05:55,990
block diagram to explain how the

117
0:05:55,990 --> 0:05:57,550
circuits actually gonna work but

118
0:05:57,550 --> 0:05:59,110
basically we're gonna use a relay bank

119
0:05:59,110 --> 0:06:00,789
to control the outputs of each high

120
0:06:00,789 --> 0:06:04,360
voltage module using Arduino the power

121
0:06:04,360 --> 0:06:05,649
input is from the lithium polymer

122
0:06:05,649 --> 0:06:07,839
battery now we actually have a more

123
0:06:07,839 --> 0:06:09,639
detailed electronics diagram which you

124
0:06:09,639 --> 0:06:10,839
can check out using the link in the

[Music]

128
0:06:46,880 --> 0:06:51,170
better he's connected l okay miss powers

129
0:06:51,170 --> 0:07:00,780
are doing

130
0:07:00,780 --> 0:07:04,800
ready for its first test to the most

131
0:07:04,800 --> 0:07:06,180
realistic thing about this aircraft is

132
0:07:06,180 --> 0:07:07,650
the number of wires coming off of it

133
0:07:07,650 --> 0:07:08,970
because it was actually producing that

134
0:07:08,970 --> 0:07
much electricity you'd need some serious

135
0:07 --> 0:07:13,980
current carriers to get that energy some

136
0:07:13,980 --> 0:07:27,510
are useful

137
0:07:27,510 --> 0:07:55,490

146
0:11:00,650 --> 0:11:11,889
[Music]

147
0:11:11,889 --> 0:11:13,939
all right so we've got the arc reactor

148
0:11:13,939 --> 0:11:15,799
all set up and we have a clamp meter to

149
0:11:15,799 --> 0:11:17,209
measure the current flowing through the

150
0:11:17,209 --> 0:11:26,760
wires as we do a start-up sequence

151
0:11:26,760 --> 0:11:29,170
all right so obviously I don't have a

152
0:11:29,170 --> 0:11:30,700
hole in my chest so I can't actually

153
0:11:30,700 --> 0:11:33,430
wear this arc reactor so I thought it'd

154
0:11:33,430 --> 0:11:34,690
be nice to make a nice kind of like

155
0:11:34,690 --> 0:11:37,480
display case that we can use for one

156
0:11:37,480 --> 0:11:39,070
we're actually powering stuff using the

157
0:11:39,070 --> 0:11:54,230
arc reactor

158
0:11:54,230 --> 0:12:00,640
[Music]

159
0:12:00,640 --> 0:12:02,170
all right so we've got the arc reactor

160
0:12:02,170 --> 0:12:03,970
in its box now and we've actually got

161
0:12:03,970 --> 0:12:06,370
the switches on the box so let's open it

162
0:12:06,370 --> 0:12:15,070
up all right so main power is a switch

163
0:12:15,070 --> 0:12:18,880
here and we'll try and do a startup

164
0:12:18,880 --> 0:12:39,280
sequence

165
0:12:39,280 --> 0:12:41,540
all right let's see what else is in

166
0:12:41,540 --> 0:12:52,870
power

167
0:12:52,870 --> 0:12:55,160
all right so we're here at the main

168
0:12:55,160 --> 0:12:56,720
circuit breaker for my house and we're

169
0:12:56,720 --> 0:12:59,510
gonna plug in the arc reactor all right

170
0:12:59,510 --> 0:13:01,790
let's turn it on and see what happens

171
0:13:01,790 --> 0:13:04,870
[Applause]

172
0:13:04,870 --> 0:13:06,950
all right so these are the power meters

173
0:13:06,950 --> 0:13:09,079
for the house and as you can see that's

174
0:13:09,079 --> 0:13:10,970
how many kilowatt hours were using okay

175
0:13:10,970 --> 0:13:17,750
let's reconnect it to the grid all right

176
0:13:17,750 --> 0:13:19,190
so obviously it's not actually producing

177
0:13:19,190 --> 0:13:21,019
enough power to do anything useful but

178
0:13:21,019 --> 0:13:22,970
it certainly looks cool and sounds

179
0:13:22,970 --> 0:13:23,959
terrifying

180
0:13:23,959 --> 0:13:25,519
we'll be using it for some future gags

181
0:13:25,519 --> 0:13:27,079
in upcoming videos where we use it to

182
0:13:27,079 --> 0:13:29,060
actually power our projects one of our

183
0:13:29,060 --> 0:13:30,649
goals here is to inspire people into

184
0:13:30,649 --> 0:13:32,300
STEM fields to learn and create things

185
0:13:32,300 --> 0:13:34,399
themselves we get tons of messages

186
0:13:34,399 --> 0:13:36,050
asking how we learn to do this stuff and

187
0:13:36,050 --> 0:13:37,760
the answer is simple I'm a problem

188
0:13:37,760 --> 0:13:39,769
solver I'm not some kind of genius I

189
0:13:39,769 --> 0:13:41,089
just like to learn and use those

190
0:13:41,089 --> 0:13:43,490
concepts to make cool stuff I learned by

191
0:13:43,490 --> 0:13:44,839
doing and that's exactly what brilliant

192
0:13:44,839 --> 0:13:47,180
org allows you to do brilliant

193
0:13:47,180 --> 0:13:48,620
org is a problem-solving site that helps

194
0:13:48,620 --> 0:13:50,720
you think like an engineer by guiding

195
0:13:50,720 --> 0:13:51,950
you through the problems that bring you

196
0:13:51,950 --> 0:13:53,630
from knowing nothing to having a deep
