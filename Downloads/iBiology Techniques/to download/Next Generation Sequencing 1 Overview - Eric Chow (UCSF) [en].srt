0:00:06,399 --> 0:00:09,320
hello I'm Eric Chow I'm an assistant

2
0:00:09,320 --> 0:00:10,580
professor at the University of

3
0:00:10,580 --> 0:00:12,440
California San Francisco and I'm going

4
0:00:12,440 --> 0:00:13,129
to talk to you today about

5
0:00:13,129 --> 0:00:16,279
next-generation sequencing the outline

6
0:00:16,279 --> 0:00:18,560
of our talk today will cover traditional

7
0:00:18,560 --> 0:00:20,210
sequencing first and then we'll spend

8
0:00:20,210 --> 0:00:21,949
most of our time talking about Illumina

9
0:00:21,949 --> 0:00:24,170
sequencing by synthesis which most

10
0:00:24,170 --> 0:00:26,210
nection sequencing is being performed on

11
0:00:26,210 --> 0:00:28,250
today at the end of the talk also

12
0:00:28,250 --> 0:00:29,630
touched upon two other competing

13
0:00:29,630 --> 0:00:31,520
platforms from Oxford nanopore and

14
0:00:31,520 --> 0:00:35,719
Pacific bioscience so the human genome

15
0:00:35,719 --> 0:00:36,920
project really spurred the development

16
0:00:36,920 --> 0:00:39,859
of cheaper sequencing this was a 20-year

17
0:00:39,859 --> 0:00:42,199
effort that cost three billion dollars

18
0:00:42,199 --> 0:00:44,719
but was completed in the year 2001 and

19
0:00:44,719 --> 0:00:47,179
this lower the cost of sequencing a

20
0:00:47,179 --> 0:00:49,129
human genome to about 100 million

21
0:00:49,129 --> 0:00:51,589
dollars for a single genome and this

22
0:00:51,589 --> 0:00:54,440
used traditional singer sequencing well

23
0:00:54,440 --> 0:00:56,089
for you go into Sanger sequencing I want

24
0:00:56,089 --> 0:00:58,069
to tell you a little bit about DNA just

25
0:00:58,069 --> 0:01:00,409
to bring everybody up to speed so what I

26
0:01:00,409 --> 0:01:02,569
have depicted over here is a sequence of

27
0:01:02,569 --> 0:01:04,670
DNA it's made of two different strands

28
0:01:04,670 --> 0:01:07,010
that run anti parallel so one strand

29
0:01:07,010 --> 0:01:08,750
runs in one direction the other runs to

30
0:01:08,750 --> 0:01:10,730
the opposite direction and your sees

31
0:01:10,730 --> 0:01:13,850
hybridize two g's and your A's hybridize

32
0:01:13,850 --> 0:01:18,050
two T's sometimes DNA is depicted as as

33
0:01:18,050 --> 0:01:21,640
an arrow shown here just to simplify

34
0:01:21,640 --> 0:01:23,810
images and we'll be using this quite a

35
0:01:23,810 --> 0:01:26,450
bit today now DNA is a double-stranded

36
0:01:26,450 --> 0:01:28,730
molecule but it can be denatured and

37
0:01:28,730 --> 0:01:30,920
separated into individual strands and

38
0:01:30,920 --> 0:01:33,860
they can be renature back together or we

39
0:01:33,860 --> 0:01:36,260
can add on different sequences of DNA

40
0:01:36,260 --> 0:01:39,890
and hybridize those on such as this red

41
0:01:39,890 --> 0:01:42,290
piece of DNA over here that's now bound

42
0:01:42,290 --> 0:01:47,300
to this bottom template strand and DNA

43
0:01:47,300 --> 0:01:49,100
can be copied by polymerase --is and

44
0:01:49,100 --> 0:01:51,260
these DNA polymerase is shown here in

45
0:01:51,260 --> 0:01:53,960
orange can bind to short pieces of DNA

46
0:01:53,960 --> 0:01:55,700
that are hybridize onto a template

47
0:01:55,700 --> 0:01:59,180
strand and they can polymerize DNA with

48
0:01:59,180 --> 0:02:01,580
building blocks to extend DNA into a

49
0:02:01,580 --> 0:02:04,220
newly synthesized strand and these

50
0:02:04,220 --> 0:02:06,520
building blocks of DNA's are called

51
0:02:06,520 --> 0:02:08,629
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates and

52
0:02:08,629 --> 0:02:10,759
over here are the four different

53
0:02:10,759 --> 0:02:13,760
versions your a C's GS and T's and these

54
0:02:13,760 --> 0:02:16,670
all share several common aspects first

55
0:02:16,670 --> 0:02:19,849
there's a tri phosphate group

56
0:02:19,849 --> 0:02:22,579
that allow the growing strand to attach

57
0:02:22,579 --> 0:02:24,859
onto the building block they have a

58
0:02:24,859 --> 0:02:27,920
three prime hydroxyl group which is used

59
0:02:27,920 --> 0:02:29,989
to add on additional building blocks of

60
0:02:29,989 --> 0:02:33,140
DNA and they have four different bases

61
0:02:33,140 --> 0:02:37,189
attached to them so with traditional

62
0:02:37,189 --> 0:02:38,750
Sanger sequencing if you wanted to

63
0:02:38,750 --> 0:02:40,849
sequence a piece of DNA like this you

64
0:02:40,849 --> 0:02:43,099
would have to first denature it and add

65
0:02:43,099 --> 0:02:45,409
on a primer so that DNA polymerase can

66
0:02:45,409 --> 0:02:49,069
can bind on as the bit did here and now

67
0:02:49,069 --> 0:02:50,959
instead of adding just the traditional

68
0:02:50,959 --> 0:02:52,700
DNA bases which would allow the

69
0:02:52,700 --> 0:02:54,700
polymerase to extend this DNA molecule

70
0:02:54,700 --> 0:02:57,349
we actually use fluorescent terminators

71
0:02:57,349 --> 0:02:59,659
and fluorescent terminators are very

72
0:02:59,659 --> 0:03:01,459
similar to the DNA building blocks to

73
0:03:01,459 --> 0:03:03,859
pick adhere but there are a couple

74
0:03:03,859 --> 0:03:05,599
differences first you might notice that

75
0:03:05,599 --> 0:03:07,129
there are different colors and so

76
0:03:07,129 --> 0:03:08,659
there's a different fluorescent group

77
0:03:08,659 --> 0:03:10,609
attached to each of the four bases a

78
0:03:10,609 --> 0:03:14,930
yellow for a a blue for G a red for C

79
0:03:14,930 --> 0:03:18,530
and a green 40 additionally the 3 prime

80
0:03:18,530 --> 0:03:20,569
hydroxyl group that's present on the

81
0:03:20,569 --> 0:03:22,639
building blocks to allow DNA to continue

82
0:03:22,639 --> 0:03:25,699
extending is now terminated or removed

83
0:03:25,699 --> 0:03:27,590
this is why these are called fluorescent

84
0:03:27,590 --> 0:03:29,840
terminators they have Larsen group and a

85
0:03:29,840 --> 0:03:32,269
terminator that prevents DNA polymerase

86
0:03:32,269 --> 0:03:34,930
from further extending the DNA strand

87
0:03:34,930 --> 0:03:38,060
and so in a test tube we actually have

88
0:03:38,060 --> 0:03:40,190
billions and billions of copies of this

89
0:03:40,190 --> 0:03:42,560
template and we put in the normal DNA

90
0:03:42,560 --> 0:03:44,419
building blocks and we spike in a low

91
0:03:44,419 --> 0:03:46,489
concentration of these flush and

92
0:03:46,489 --> 0:03:49,010
terminators what results is you have a

93
0:03:49,010 --> 0:03:51,049
bunch of fragments of newly synthesized

94
0:03:51,049 --> 0:03:53,750
DNA that are all different sizes because

95
0:03:53,750 --> 0:03:56,209
they randomly incorporated a fluorescent

96
0:03:56,209 --> 0:03:58,669
Terminator and these molecules in the

97
0:03:58,669 --> 0:04:00,709
test tube are then put onto a DNA

98
0:04:00,709 --> 0:04:04,310
sequencer which will separate these and

99
0:04:04,310 --> 0:04:05,750
then allow us to determine the sequence

100
0:04:05,750 --> 0:04:08,419
what happens in the sequencer is these

101
0:04:08,419 --> 0:04:10,069
molecules are separated in size from

102
0:04:10,069 --> 0:04:12,530
largest to smallest the smallest ones

103
0:04:12,530 --> 0:04:14,419
come out of the sequencer first and get

104
0:04:14,419 --> 0:04:16,729
detected and then the next piece of DNA

105
0:04:16,729 --> 0:04:19,940
gets detected and the next and the trace

106
0:04:19,940 --> 0:04:21,620
that comes out of the DNA sequencer is a

107
0:04:21,620 --> 0:04:23,810
chromatogram down here at the bottom and

108
0:04:23,810 --> 0:04:27,860
if you follow the color changes as each

109
0:04:27,860 --> 0:04:29,510
of the different pieces of DNA come out

110
0:04:29,510 --> 0:04:31,070
of the sequencer you can build up your

111
0:04:31,070 --> 0:04:33,430
DNA sequence

112
0:04:33,430 --> 0:04:36,530
these machines can run up to 384 samples

113
0:04:36,530 --> 0:04:39,650
at a time and generate about 700 bases

114
0:04:39,650 --> 0:04:41,599
of sequence for each of those samples

115
0:04:41,599 --> 0:04:43,909
and you can sequence up to 1 million

116
0:04:43,909 --> 0:04:46,580
pieces of DNA or 1 million bases of DNA

117
0:04:46,580 --> 0:04:48,770
in a single day now this might sound

118
0:04:48,770 --> 0:04:50,449
like a lot but when you consider the

119
0:04:50,449 --> 0:04:52,430
human genome is actually 6 billion bases

120
0:04:52,430 --> 0:04:55,009
and to sequence the human genome you

121
0:04:55,009 --> 0:04:56,930
actually sample it many many times

122
0:04:56,930 --> 0:04:59,870
sometimes on average of 7 times this

123
0:04:59,870 --> 0:05:00,919
means that if you were to try to

124
0:05:00,919 --> 0:05:02,870
sequence a single human genome on one

125
0:05:02,870 --> 0:05:04,999
sequencing machine it would take about a

126
0:05:04,999 --> 0:05:08,029
hundred years and so clearly the human

127
0:05:08,029 --> 0:05:10,729
genome project was completed in much

128
0:05:10,729 --> 0:05:12,469
under 100 years and this was made

129
0:05:12,469 --> 0:05:14,629
possible by factories of these

130
0:05:14,629 --> 0:05:16,550
sequencing instruments over here is a

131
0:05:16,550 --> 0:05:18,860
single sequencing instrument in this

132
0:05:18,860 --> 0:05:20,389
huge factory where we have sometimes

133
0:05:20,389 --> 0:05:21,979
dozens or even hundreds of these

134
0:05:21,979 --> 0:05:27,669
machines running 24/7 365 days a year so

135
0:05:27,669 --> 0:05:31,159
the human genome was was a really great

136
0:05:31,159 --> 0:05:33,050
undertaking generated a lot of useful

137
0:05:33,050 --> 0:05:36,259
data but it was only came from the

138
0:05:36,259 --> 0:05:38,089
genetic material of several people and

139
0:05:38,089 --> 0:05:40,370
so we still don't understand most of

140
0:05:40,370 --> 0:05:42,379
what this genome does you know we have

141
0:05:42,379 --> 0:05:43,969
the sequence but again it's only from a

142
0:05:43,969 --> 0:05:46,189
small subset but to really understand

143
0:05:46,189 --> 0:05:48,169
the function of the genome we need a

144
0:05:48,169 --> 0:05:50,360
sequence thousands to millions of

145
0:05:50,360 --> 0:05:53,300
different people to really sample the

146
0:05:53,300 --> 0:05:57,560
variety of genetic material present in

147
0:05:57,560 --> 0:06:00,589
the human population and it's obvious we

148
0:06:00,589 --> 0:06:02,060
can't do this with traditional senior

149
0:06:02,060 --> 0:06:04,909
sequencing so luckily over the past two

150
0:06:04,909 --> 0:06:06,620
decades the cost of sequencing has

151
0:06:06,620 --> 0:06:08,960
dropped dramatically over here's a chart

152
0:06:08,960 --> 0:06:10,430
showing you how much it costs to

153
0:06:10,430 --> 0:06:13,219
sequence 1 million bases of DNA when the

154
0:06:13,219 --> 0:06:15,050
human genome project completed in 2001

155
0:06:15,050 --> 0:06:19,520
it cost almost $10,000 today we're

156
0:06:19,520 --> 0:06:22,009
approaching one cent to sequence a

157
0:06:22,009 --> 0:06:23,899
million bases of DNA which represents a

158
0:06:23,899 --> 0:06:26,599
1 million fold drop in the cost of

159
0:06:26,599 --> 0:06:29,419
sequencing and if you follow this chart

160
0:06:29,419 --> 0:06:30,439
you can see that there are several

161
0:06:30,439 --> 0:06:36,020
inflection points in 2007 2010 and 2015

162
0:06:36,020 --> 0:06:38,120
where prices had some fairly steep drops

163
0:06:38,120 --> 0:06:40,939
and these were largely driven by new

164
0:06:40,939 --> 0:06:42,889
sequencing systems introduced by

165
0:06:42,889 --> 0:06:45,080
Illumina the dominant player in the

166
0:06:45,080 --> 0:06:46,730
next-gen sequencing market

167
0:06:46,730 --> 0:06:49,160
on this slide are three different types

168
0:06:49,160 --> 0:06:50,540
of sequencers from Illumina they

169
0:06:50,540 --> 0:06:52,070
actually have several more but they

170
0:06:52,070 --> 0:06:53,960
really span the the scale of sequencing

171
0:06:53,960 --> 0:06:56,180
that's being offered on the left-hand

172
0:06:56,180 --> 0:06:58,430
side is aluminum IC instrument in the

173
0:06:58,430 --> 0:07:00,320
middle is the high seek and on the right

174
0:07:00,320 --> 0:07:03,080
is the Nova seek the newest high output

175
0:07:03,080 --> 0:07:05,240
sequencer from Illumina and if we

176
0:07:05,240 --> 0:07:07,550
compare the output of these machines and

177
0:07:07,550 --> 0:07:08,510
comparing with the Sanger sequencing

178
0:07:08,510 --> 0:07:11,300
platforms we can see just how much more

179
0:07:11,300 --> 0:07:12,710
sequence we can generate from these

180
0:07:12,710 --> 0:07:14,300
instruments if you just look at how many

181
0:07:14,300 --> 0:07:16,460
reads you can get from a single run the

182
0:07:16,460 --> 0:07:19,100
mic generates 30 million reads the high

183
0:07:19,100 --> 0:07:21,260
C generates three billion reads the Nova

184
0:07:21,260 --> 0:07:24,230
C generates 13 billion reads while the

185
0:07:24,230 --> 0:07:27,430
Sanger sequencing system generates about

186
0:07:27,430 --> 0:07:30,290
400 reads and so it's a huge difference

187
0:07:30,290 --> 0:07:32,150
and if you just look at this in terms of

188
0:07:32,150 --> 0:07:33,980
how much sequence you can generate in a

189
0:07:33,980 --> 0:07:37,190
single day you can generate up to four

190
0:07:37,190 --> 0:07:40,160
trillion bases on the Nova seek in one

191
0:07:40,160 --> 0:07:43,070
single day compared to 1 million bases

192
0:07:43,070 --> 0:07:45,700
on the traditional sinker instrument

193
0:07:45,700 --> 0:07:48,290
Illumina sequencing is the dominant

194
0:07:48,290 --> 0:07:49,460
player in the market

195
0:07:49,460 --> 0:07:51,980
it's an imaging based method and

196
0:07:51,980 --> 0:07:54,110
generates many many reads millions to

197
0:07:54,110 --> 0:07:56,270
billions of reads per run and from each

198
0:07:56,270 --> 0:07:58,790
of these reads we can generate 300 to

199
0:07:58,790 --> 0:08:02,090
600 bases of sequence it's really really

200
0:08:02,090 --> 0:08:04,840
accurate the error rate is roughly 1 in

201
0:08:04,840 --> 0:08:08,300
1,000 bases and with the new machines we

202
0:08:08,300 --> 0:08:10,010
can actually sequence a human genome for

203
0:08:10,010 --> 0:08:14,660
$1,000 in less than 48 hours and the

204
0:08:14,660 --> 0:08:16,370
sequencing on these Illumina platforms

205
0:08:16,370 --> 0:08:17,810
happens in flow cells these are

206
0:08:17,810 --> 0:08:19,340
essentially microscope slides with

207
0:08:19,340 --> 0:08:22,040
channels on the inside what I have shown

208
0:08:22,040 --> 0:08:24,080
here is a my seek flow cell next to a

209
0:08:24,080 --> 0:08:26,180
standard Eppendorf tube that's used for

210
0:08:26,180 --> 0:08:28,820
a lot of lab work and these tubes are

211
0:08:28,820 --> 0:08:30,740
pretty small about one and a half inches

212
0:08:30,740 --> 0:08:33,650
in height and on this my C flow cell we

213
0:08:33,650 --> 0:08:35,510
can generate about months at 30 million

214
0:08:35,510 --> 0:08:39,470
reads per run next up is the high C flow

215
0:08:39,470 --> 0:08:41,060
so you can see it's quite a bit larger

216
0:08:41,060 --> 0:08:42,800
than the my C flow cell and this larger

217
0:08:42,800 --> 0:08:44,930
real estate allows us to generate more

218
0:08:44,930 --> 0:08:47,420
reads in a single run approaching three

219
0:08:47,420 --> 0:08:50,810
billion reads and lastly is the Nova C

220
0:08:50,810 --> 0:08:53,180
Klose which is even larger and on this

221
0:08:53,180 --> 0:08:55,040
flow cell we can generate 13 billion

222
0:08:55,040 --> 0:08:58,840
reads in a single run

223
0:08:58,840 --> 0:09
so you can't just put DNA into these

224
0:09 --> 0:09:02,470
flow cells and get sequences out you

225
0:09:02,470 --> 0:09:03,940
actually have to prepare your sample and

226
0:09:03,940 --> 0:09:05,710
so there are several steps that occur

227
0:09:05,710 --> 0:09:07,690
but basically what happens is you take

228
0:09:07,690 --> 0:09:09,820
your sample that you want a sequence

229
0:09:09,820 --> 0:09:11,890
which is DNA if you have something like

230
0:09:11,890 --> 0:09:14,110
RNA you can convert it with enzymes into

231
0:09:14,110 --> 0:09:16,780
DNA you take that DNA and then you have

232
0:09:16,780 --> 0:09:18,580
to add on these adapter sequences at the

233
0:09:18,580 --> 0:09:21,250
end so in blue our primer binding sites

234
0:09:21,250 --> 0:09:23,440
that allow the sequencing reaction to

235
0:09:23,440 --> 0:09:24,940
occur this is similar to sing your

236
0:09:24,940 --> 0:09:26,230
sequencing where we needed to have a

237
0:09:26,230 --> 0:09:29,140
primer bind for DNA polymerase to move

238
0:09:29,140 --> 0:09:31,450
along at the template DNA and then we

239
0:09:31,450 --> 0:09:33,190
also have these capture sequences in

240
0:09:33,190 --> 0:09:36,970
green and orange and these allow your

241
0:09:36,970 --> 0:09:40,390
sequencing sample to be captured on to

242
0:09:40,390 --> 0:09:43,420
the flow cell for sequencing once you

243
0:09:43,420 --> 0:09:45,520
have your DNA sample prepared

244
0:09:45,520 --> 0:09:47,800
it's a double-stranded molecule that

245
0:09:47,800 --> 0:09:49,870
which we denature and put into the flow

246
0:09:49,870 --> 0:09:52,240
cell and on the left-hand side again is

247
0:09:52,240 --> 0:09:54,730
a picture of the high C flow cell so

248
0:09:54,730 --> 0:09:56,680
there are eight channels and samples

249
0:09:56,680 --> 0:09:58,900
actually go into the glass slide there

250
0:09:58,900 --> 0:10:00,220
are eight different channels within

251
0:10:00,220 --> 0:10:03,670
there and inside of the slide are a

252
0:10:03,670 --> 0:10:08,650
mixture of short DNA molecules in orange

253
0:10:08,650 --> 0:10:10,540
and green and these orange green

254
0:10:10,540 --> 0:10:13,810
molecules will bind to both ends of your

255
0:10:13,810 --> 0:10:16,150
sequencing library so we denature our

256
0:10:16,150 --> 0:10:18,730
sample flow those into the flow cell and

257
0:10:18,730 --> 0:10:20,740
they can get captured by these primers

258
0:10:20,740 --> 0:10:23,290
are these short DNA molecules on the

259
0:10:23,290 --> 0:10:25,690
surface of the slide and once that

260
0:10:25,690 --> 0:10:28,090
occurs a DNA polymerase is added in the

261
0:10:28,090 --> 0:10:30,190
DNA building blocks introduced and we

262
0:10:30,190 --> 0:10:31,840
copy that template and so we have a

263
0:10:31,840 --> 0:10:34,030
newly synthesized strand that's now

264
0:10:34,030 --> 0:10:36,430
physically constrained to the bottom of

265
0:10:36,430 --> 0:10:39,520
the flow cell we wash out the original

266
0:10:39,520 --> 0:10:41,530
template strand and then allow the newly

267
0:10:41,530 --> 0:10:44,110
synthesized strand to now bind on to the

268
0:10:44,110 --> 0:10
other DNA sequence present on the

269
0:10 --> 0:10:47,710
surface in this case the orange piece

270
0:10:47,710 --> 0:10:51,130
and then we flow in some DNA polymerase

271
0:10:51,130 --> 0:10:52,540
and building blocks and we get another

272
0:10:52,540 --> 0:10:54,580
strand formed and we repeat this process

273
0:10:54,580 --> 0:10:57,310
many many times and in the end we get

274
0:10:57,310 --> 0:11:00,250
about a thousand copies within a cluster

275
0:11:00,250 --> 0:11:02,260
and remember that these thousand

276
0:11:02,260 --> 0:11:03,700
molecules all came from the same

277
0:11:03,700 --> 0:11:05,500
original template strand so they all

278
0:11:05,500 --> 0:11:08,650
have the same sequence we denature to

279
0:11:08,650 --> 0:11:10,630
the strands and then we can selectively

280
0:11:10,630 --> 0:11:12,850
cleave off one of the ala goes

281
0:11:12,850 --> 0:11:15,310
or the primers in this case the green

282
0:11:15,310 --> 0:11:17,889
one and we've washed those away so now

283
0:11:17,889 --> 0:11:19,930
all the thousand molecules present are

284
0:11:19,930 --> 0:11:21,850
all the identical strand because we

285
0:11:21,850 --> 0:11:24,819
removed the other strand we flow in a

286
0:11:24,819 --> 0:11:27,130
sequencing primer and now the clustering

287
0:11:27,130 --> 0:11:30,550
process is complete and this is the

288
0:11:30,550 --> 0:11:32,170
instrument that performs clustering so

289
0:11:32,170 --> 0:11:34,569
first thing we do is we take a brand new

290
0:11:34,569 --> 0:11:37,060
flow cell again this is the size of a

291
0:11:37,060 --> 0:11:39,190
standard microscope slide and then we

292
0:11:39,190 --> 0:11:41,589
put it on to the stage of the instrument

293
0:11:41,589 --> 0:11:46,209
and the stage is a region of the

294
0:11:46,209 --> 0:11:47,560
instrument that can actually heat and

295
0:11:47,560 --> 0:11:49,449
cool to perform a lot of the enzymatic

296
0:11:49,449 --> 0:11:51,940
reactions next we load a blue plates of

297
0:11:51,940 --> 0:11:53,800
the reagents that perform the clustering

298
0:11:53,800 --> 0:11:56,470
and lastly a strip tube with the eight

299
0:11:56,470 --> 0:11:58,029
different samples that are going to be

300
0:11:58,029 --> 0:12:01,329
loaded onto that flow cell next a

301
0:12:01,329 --> 0:12:03,370
manifold is mounted on top of the flow

302
0:12:03,370 --> 0:12:07,389
cell and connected to the SI BOTS and in

303
0:12:07,389 --> 0:12:08,680
the back of the SI bot or this

304
0:12:08,680 --> 0:12:10,300
clustering instrument are a series of

305
0:12:10,300 --> 0:12
pumps that will now pull reagents from

306
0:12 --> 0:12:15,069
the blue reagent plate or from our

307
0:12:15,069 --> 0:12:17,439
samples trip tube and pass them through

308
0:12:17,439 --> 0:12:20,050
the flow cell and this is how reagents

309
0:12:20,050 --> 0:12:22,720
and and liquids are delivered and at

310
0:12:22,720 --> 0:12:24,449
this point the clustering procedure

311
0:12:24,449 --> 0:12:26,920
takes about three to four hours and once

312
0:12:26,920 --> 0:12:29,620
that's done we take that flow cell and

313
0:12:29,620 --> 0:12:31,600
move it on to the actual sequencer in

314
0:12:31,600 --> 0:12:34,630
this case a hi-c instrument and on the

315
0:12:34,630 --> 0:12:35,889
high seek instrument we have a

316
0:12:35,889 --> 0:12:37,959
refrigerated compartment for all the

317
0:12:37,959 --> 0:12:40,329
sequencing or agents a lot of enzymes in

318
0:12:40,329 --> 0:12:42,040
there that need to be kept cool during

319
0:12:42,040 --> 0:12:43,860
the three to four day secuence iran

320
0:12:43,860 --> 0:12:46,300
above the refrigerated section is a

321
0:12:46,300 --> 0:12:49,269
series of pumps that pull reagents from

322
0:12:49,269 --> 0:12:51,819
that refrigerated compartment and send

323
0:12:51,819 --> 0:12:54,430
them to the flow cell which we will now

324
0:12:54,430 --> 0:12:56,980
load onto the stage and so that is the

325
0:12:56,980 --> 0:12:59,290
flow cell from the c bot that just

326
0:12:59,290 --> 0:13:01,930
completed clustering this gets mounted

327
0:13:01,930 --> 0:13:04,470
onto a stage and locked in place and

328
0:13:04,470 --> 0:13:07,149
then we can begin the sequencing run and

329
0:13:07,149 --> 0:13:09,370
what that does is that will trigger the

330
0:13:09,370 --> 0:13:12,459
pumps to start flowing reagents from the

331
0:13:12,459 --> 0:13:15,089
refer to compartment into the flow cell

332
0:13:15,089 --> 0:13:19,480
and behind the flow cell is actually a

333
0:13:19,480 --> 0:13:22,480
really powerful microscope that is used

334
0:13:22,480 --> 0:13:24,760
to actually sequence each of those

335
0:13:24,760 --> 0:13:26,560
molecules of DNA

336
0:13:26,560 --> 0:13:29,680
and so remember that when we put the

337
0:13:29,680 --> 0:13:32,199
flow cell on to the sequencer this is

338
0:13:32,199 --> 0:13:34,269
what it looks like we have a lot of

339
0:13:34,269 --> 0:13:36,999
clusters that each have a sequencing

340
0:13:36,999 --> 0:13:39,730
primer bound to them and the chemistry

341
0:13:39,730 --> 0:13:42,430
for sequencing is very similar to the

342
0:13:42,430 --> 0:13:44,860
singer sequencing terminators that were

343
0:13:44,860 --> 0:13:46,120
used but the one difference is that

344
0:13:46,120 --> 0:13:48,309
these are reversible and so they're

345
0:13:48,309 --> 0:13:51,490
reversible in in two ways so first these

346
0:13:51,490 --> 0:13:53,439
can be incorporated into the clusters by

347
0:13:53,439 --> 0:13:55,930
a DNA polymerase and those clusters will

348
0:13:55,930 --> 0:13:57,550
light up in four different colors

349
0:13:57,550 --> 0:13:58,720
depending on which base gets

350
0:13:58,720 --> 0:14:01,449
incorporated a picture is taken and

351
0:14:01,449 --> 0:14:02,769
after that picture is taken we can

352
0:14:02,769 --> 0:14:05,230
actually remove these terminators and

353
0:14:05,230 --> 0:14:06,490
the fluorescent groups with some

354
0:14:06,490 --> 0:14:09,069
chemicals and what results is we

355
0:14:09,069 --> 0:14:10,839
regenerate the three prime hydroxyl

356
0:14:10,839 --> 0:14:13,600
groups so now that cluster can have

357
0:14:13,600 --> 0:14:17,230
another round of bases added to it and

358
0:14:17,230 --> 0:14:19,180
so this is what it looks like for a

359
0:14:19,180 --> 0:14:21,910
single molecule on this end over here we

360
0:14:21,910 --> 0:14:24,819
have our template strand bound to a

361
0:14:24,819 --> 0:14:27,309
sequencing primer and this allows DNA

362
0:14:27,309 --> 0:14:29,800
polymerase to bind and then add the base

363
0:14:29,800 --> 0:14:32,079
in this case isn't yellow one so once

364
0:14:32,079 --> 0:14:34,110
this gets added a picture is taken and

365
0:14:34,110 --> 0:14:37,029
then we add chemicals to remove the

366
0:14:37,029 --> 0:14:38,800
fluorescent group and the terminator so

367
0:14:38,800 --> 0:14:40,269
that DNA polymerase can add a second

368
0:14:40,269 --> 0:14:43,120
base an image is taken chemistry is

369
0:14:43,120 --> 0:14:45,160
performed to remove that base and to

370
0:14:45,160 --> 0:14:46,930
regenerate the three prime hydroxyl and

371
0:14:46,930 --> 0:14:50,410
then we can add another base and so over

372
0:14:50,410 --> 0:14:52,149
time the cycle just repeats over and

373
0:14:52,149 --> 0:14:55,180
over again with multiple cycles of a

374
0:14:55,180 --> 0:14:58,930
base Edition imaging and then chemistry

375
0:14:58,930 --> 0:15:02,769
to remove the blocks and so if we look

376
0:15:02,769 --> 0:15:04,689
at take a look at this depiction of five

377
0:15:04,689 --> 0:15:06,250
different cycles so each of these

378
0:15:06,250 --> 0:15:08,379
represents a different image taken and

379
0:15:08,379 --> 0:15:12,189
if we follow the top left and the bottom

380
0:15:12,189 --> 0:15:15,129
right clusters and see how those colors

381
0:15:15,129 --> 0:15:18,129
changes over time we can actually build

382
0:15:18,129 --> 0:15:20,110
the sequence so the top cluster the

383
0:15:20,110 --> 0:15:23,709
sequence is going to be AG C C T because

384
0:15:23,709 --> 0:15:25,990
it goes from yellow blue red red green

385
0:15:25,990 --> 0:15:30,999
and the bottom one is G t AAC and so

386
0:15:30,999 --> 0:15:32,350
again the power of the system is that

387
0:15:32,350 --> 0:15:34,360
you can sequence up to billions of

388
0:15:34,360 --> 0:15:36,279
sequences at the same time in parallel

389
0:15:36,279 --> 0:15:38,740
and this is what gives these instruments

390
0:15:38,740 --> 0:15:39,840
their throughput

391
0:15:39,840 --> 0:15:42,120
so some people ask me why can't we

392
0:15:42,120 --> 0:15
increase the amount of bases that we get

393
0:15 --> 0:15:46,650
in a single read by just repeating the

394
0:15:46,650 --> 0:15:48,450
country over and over again do this a

395
0:15:48,450 --> 0:15:50,520
thousand two thousand ten thousand times

396
0:15:50,520 --> 0:15:53,400
and the main reason why is that the

397
0:15:53,400 --> 0:15:55,200
enzymes and chemistry's aren't perfect

398
0:15:55,200 --> 0:15:59,040
so over here I have a cluster of one

399
0:15:59,040 --> 0:16:01,200
single cluster made out of the same

400
0:16:01,200 --> 0:16:03,960
template molecules but what happens is

401
0:16:03,960 --> 0:16:06,779
because chemistry isn't perfect some of

402
0:16:06,779 --> 0:16:08,880
the strands lag behind so this one is a

403
0:16:08,880 --> 0:16:11,010
yellow instead of a green and some

404
0:16:11,010 --> 0:16:13,290
clusters jump ahead so this one is now a

405
0:16:13,290 --> 0:16:15,690
red instead of a green because it hopped

406
0:16:15,690 --> 0:16:19,110
ahead and what happens is these errors

407
0:16:19,110 --> 0:16:21,630
aren't too bad but over time and many

408
0:16:21,630 --> 0:16:23,850
many cycles over the course of 100 200

409
0:16:23,850 --> 0:16:26,790
300 cycles more and more strands start

410
0:16:26,790 --> 0:16:29,070
to lag and more start to jump ahead so

411
0:16:29,070 --> 0:16:30,570
that your true signal starts to

412
0:16:30,570 --> 0:16:32,430
disappear and gets weaker and weaker and

413
0:16:32,430 --> 0:16:34,620
this really limits Illumina sequencing

414
0:16:34,620 --> 0:16:39,480
to about 300 bases for each read so with

415
0:16:39,480 --> 0:16:41,220
the the Illumina sequencer four

416
0:16:41,220 --> 0:16:43,230
different images are taken during each

417
0:16:43,230 --> 0:16:44,940
cycle one for each of the four color

418
0:16:44,940 --> 0:16:48,600
bases and so the images actually look

419
0:16:48,600 --> 0:16:50,700
like this they're not very clear they're

420
0:16:50,700 --> 0:16:52,620
not perfect circles and they're very

421
0:16:52,620 --> 0:16:55,740
difficult to see by I just figure out

422
0:16:55,740 --> 0:16:57,570
where one cluster starts and another

423
0:16:57,570 --> 0:16:59,760
begins you know one example is here

424
0:16:59,760 --> 0:17:01,260
let's say in the first cycle we have two

425
0:17:01,260 --> 0:17:04,140
clusters that are both G these just look

426
0:17:04,140 --> 0:17:05,939
like a single blob that's a single color

427
0:17:05,939 --> 0:17:07,170
and this is really hard for the

428
0:17:07,170 --> 0:17:09,209
sequencer to pick out but because we're

429
0:17:09,209 --> 0:17:11,520
sequencing many many sequences at a time

430
0:17:11,520 --> 0:17:13,230
in parallel chances are these aren't

431
0:17:13,230 --> 0:17:14,880
identical sequences and if we go through

432
0:17:14,880 --> 0:17:17,280
another cycle you know chances are that

433
0:17:17,280 --> 0:17:19,260
they'll have a difference so now this

434
0:17:19,260 --> 0:17:21,810
cluster on the right is an a while the

435
0:17:21,810 --> 0:17:23,939
cluster on the left is still a G but

436
0:17:23,939 --> 0:17:25,740
because of this the sequencer can now

437
0:17:25,740 --> 0:17:28,890
compare these images and determine where

438
0:17:28,890 --> 0:17:31,620
cluster a has a very pure signal where

439
0:17:31,620 --> 0:17:33,630
there's a mixture between cluster a and

440
0:17:33,630 --> 0:17:36,030
B and where cluster B has a pure signal

441
0:17:36,030 --> 0:17:38,760
and a little side to just take imaging

442
0:17:38,760 --> 0:17:41,760
information from just these clean areas

443
0:17:41,760 --> 0:17:45,780
where do they have very pure signal so

444
0:17:45,780 --> 0:17:47,730
again this is for color chemistry from

445
0:17:47,730 --> 0:17:49,290
Illumina this is what had been used for

446
0:17:49,290 --> 0:17:51,660
for many many years and it was very

447
0:17:51,660 --> 0:17:53,670
clear and obvious one color for each

448
0:17:53,670 --> 0:17:55,740
the four bases but there are issues with

449
0:17:55,740 --> 0:17:58,860
this so the colors depicted here you

450
0:17:58,860 --> 0:18:00,060
know you can tell the colors are very

451
0:18:00,060 --> 0:18:01,500
very different however if you actually

452
0:18:01,500 --> 0:18:03,900
look at the emission spectra you can see

453
0:18:03,900 --> 0:18:05,640
there's significant overlap between the

454
0:18:05,640 --> 0:18:07,770
four colors and this requires the

455
0:18:07,770 --> 0:18:10,050
instruments to undergo a lot of color

456
0:18:10,050 --> 0:18:11,340
compensation and then this can

457
0:18:11,340 --> 0:18:14,100
contribute to errors so a few years ago

458
0:18:14,100 --> 0:18:16,350
in Lumina introduced two color chemistry

459
0:18:16,350 --> 0:18:18,150
so instead of using four colors to

460
0:18:18,150 --> 0:18:19,560
represent four bases they're now using

461
0:18:19,560 --> 0:18:22,800
two colors to represent four bases in

462
0:18:22,800 --> 0:18:24,510
this case they're using red and green

463
0:18:24,510 --> 0:18:27,080
and the way this works is that you have

464
0:18:27,080 --> 0:18:31,380
T's which are green C's which are red a

465
0:18:31,380 --> 0:18:34,020
s which are actually a mix of both color

466
0:18:34,020 --> 0:18:36,150
so you'll see them in both images and

467
0:18:36,150 --> 0:18:38,700
then G's actually have no color or no

468
0:18:38,700 --> 0:18:41,150
signal and so this is how you can encode

469
0:18:41,150 --> 0:18:43,650
four different bases with only two

470
0:18:43,650 --> 0:18:46,320
colors and so initially the quality of

471
0:18:46,320 --> 0:18:48,150
the two color chemistry wasn't as great

472
0:18:48,150 --> 0:18:49,950
as the four color chemistry but recent

473
0:18:49,950 --> 0:18:51,570
developments on the Novus II platform

474
0:18:51,570 --> 0:18:53,490
one of them luminous newer sequencers

475
0:18:53,490 --> 0:18:55,710
that uses two colors the data quality

476
0:18:55,710 --> 0:18:57,390
actually rivals the four color

477
0:18:57,390 --> 0:18:59,280
instruments and so there's definitely

478
0:18:59,280 --> 0:19:01,590
been some improvements in this area the

479
0:19:01,590 --> 0:19:03,360
other benefit of two color sequencing is

480
0:19:03,360 --> 0:19:04,530
that these reagents are generally

481
0:19:04,530 --> 0:19:05,970
cheaper to make because you don't have

482
0:19:05,970 --> 0:19:07,770
to have so many colors and the

483
0:19:07,770 --> 0:19:08,760
instruments are also less expensive

484
0:19:08,760 --> 0:19:11,130
because you only have to capture two

485
0:19:11,130 --> 0:19:13,800
images instead of four so how far can

486
0:19:13,800 --> 0:19:15,540
you take this can you do sequencing with

487
0:19:15,540 --> 0:19:17,310
only a single color and the answer is

488
0:19:17,310 --> 0:19:19,890
yes a newer platform just a release by

489
0:19:19,890 --> 0:19:23,190
Illumina uses a single color to encode

490
0:19:23,190 --> 0:19:24,840
for different bases

491
0:19:24,840 --> 0:19:28,110
and they do this by taking two images

492
0:19:28,110 --> 0:19:30,420
that are separated by a chemistry step

493
0:19:30,420 --> 0:19:32,280
in the middle so I'll walk you through

494
0:19:32,280 --> 0:19:34,620
this in the first image they add the

495
0:19:34,620 --> 0:19:36,210
four different bases and in this case

496
0:19:36,210 --> 0:19:39,270
the A's and T's have a color on there

497
0:19:39,270 --> 0:19:41,490
and again it's the same color the season

498
0:19:41,490 --> 0:19:44,460
G's don't have any color one thing to

499
0:19:44,460 --> 0:19:46,950
note is the a base has a cleavable

500
0:19:46,950 --> 0:19:50,460
linkage between the base and the color

501
0:19:50,460 --> 0:19:55,110
and the sea base has a molecule that we

502
0:19:55,110 --> 0:19
can use to attach something later on so

503
0:19 --> 0:19:59,040
we take an image first so a Slav color

504
0:19:59,040 --> 0:20:01,920
and T's will have color CS and G's will

505
0:20:01,920 --> 0:20:04,380
not have any color next we go through a

506
0:20:04,380 --> 0:20:07,600
chemistry step that will cleave there

507
0:20:07,600 --> 0:20:09,940
green color from the a basis and it'll

508
0:20:09,940 --> 0:20:12,130
add a molecule that will bind to the C

509
0:20:12,130 --> 0:20:15,549
basis and make them now colored and so

510
0:20:15,549 --> 0:20:17,350
we take a second image so in the second

511
0:20:17,350 --> 0:20:19,480
image A's won't have any color because

512
0:20:19,480 --> 0:20:22,720
any that did had them cleaved off the G

513
0:20:22,720 --> 0:20:25,090
still won't have any color but both the

514
0:20:25,090 --> 0:20:27,039
C's and T's will have color and what

515
0:20:27,039 --> 0:20:28,390
this looks like if you break this down

516
0:20:28,390 --> 0:20:31,090
is if you compare a single cluster and

517
0:20:31,090 --> 0:20:33,549
look at its color whether it's on or off

518
0:20:33,549 --> 0:20:35,950
between image one or two you can get

519
0:20:35,950 --> 0:20:39,340
four different basis outs so these are

520
0:20:39,340 --> 0:20:40,720
the different flavors of Illumina

521
0:20:40,720 --> 0:20:42,250
sequencing we started off with four

522
0:20:42,250 --> 0:20:43,870
color chemistry move to two color

523
0:20:43,870 --> 0:20:45,370
chemistry now we have one color

524
0:20:45,370 --> 0:20:47,289
chemistry all these chemistry's are

525
0:20:47,289 --> 0:20:48,880
still used currently on existing

526
0:20:48,880 --> 0:20:51,220
platforms and each of them have have

527
0:20:51,220 --> 0:20:54,429
their benefits so now we're gonna move

528
0:20:54,429 --> 0:20:56,350
over to the long greet sequencers we're

529
0:20:56,350 --> 0:20:57,640
going to start with Oxford nanopore

530
0:20:57,640 --> 0:21:00,070
sequencing and with this sequencing

531
0:21:00,070 --> 0:21:02,110
technology it uses these Nana pores

532
0:21:02,110 --> 0:21:04,600
which are extremely small pores with

533
0:21:04,600 --> 0:21:06,730
really small gaps in them so in this

534
0:21:06,730 --> 0:21:08,860
case one point eight nanometers that are

535
0:21:08,860 --> 0:21:11,500
embedded in lipid membranes these lipid

536
0:21:11,500 --> 0:21:13,390
membranes act as a barrier that prevent

537
0:21:13,390 --> 0:21:15,250
currents from going back and forth so

538
0:21:15,250 --> 0:21:16,990
currents have to pass through the pore

539
0:21:16,990 --> 0:21:19,390
and the way the Nana 4c would serve

540
0:21:19,390 --> 0:21:22,690
works is single-stranded DNA or even RNA

541
0:21:22,690 --> 0:21:24,880
in this case now our threaded through

542
0:21:24,880 --> 0:21:27,340
the pore and depending on which bases

543
0:21:27,340 --> 0:21:29,679
are in the pore to give a moment that

544
0:21:29,679 --> 0:21:31,570
changes the current that's read out and

545
0:21:31,570 --> 0:21:33,429
detectors can measure this change in

546
0:21:33,429 --> 0:21:35,559
current and over here is just a

547
0:21:35,559 --> 0:21:37,630
depiction of what this looks like so for

548
0:21:37,630 --> 0:21:39,700
instance you might have a symbol of one

549
0:21:39,700 --> 0:21:41,679
level of current for your T's a

550
0:21:41,679 --> 0:21:44,919
different ones for G's something else

551
0:21:44,919 --> 0:21:46,929
for C's and then another level of

552
0:21:46,929 --> 0:21:49,510
current for Ace and you can just measure

553
0:21:49,510 --> 0:21:51,850
these current traces over time and build

554
0:21:51,850 --> 0:21:54,280
a sequence and in reality the traces

555
0:21:54,280 --> 0:21:56,799
don't look this clean because in the

556
0:21:56,799 --> 0:21:59,260
pore they're actually up to six bases at

557
0:21:59,260 --> 0:22:02,110
a time present and with six bases times

558
0:22:02,110 --> 0:22:04,419
four different possible bases for your a

559
0:22:04,419 --> 0:22:07,299
C's GS and T's this generates up to

560
0:22:07,299 --> 0:22:10,240
4,000 different possible states and so

561
0:22:10,240 --> 0:22:12,340
it's really a technical tour de force to

562
0:22:12,340 --> 0:22:15,490
get this to work but today you can get

563
0:22:15,490 --> 0:22:17,230
this to work you can buy these systems

564
0:22:17,230 --> 0:22
and they do have high error rates

565
0:22 --> 0:22:21,309
anywhere from 10 to 15%

566
0:22:21,309 --> 0:22:23,889
and these errors tend to be biased but

567
0:22:23,889 --> 0:22:25,389
you can get really really long reads the

568
0:22:25,389 --> 0:22:27,970
current record is a two mega base or 2

569
0:22:27,970 --> 0:22:30,820
million base read from a single piece of

570
0:22:30,820 --> 0:22:34,240
DNA and again as I mentioned you can now

571
0:22:34,240 --> 0:22:36,039
directly sequence RNA so you don't have

572
0:22:36,039 --> 0:22:38,620
to convert that to DNA and they're even

573
0:22:38,620 --> 0:22:40,840
possibilities of sequencing proteins in

574
0:22:40,840 --> 0:22:43,649
the future which will be very exciting

575
0:22:43,649 --> 0:22:45,940
the other benefit of the Oxford nanopore

576
0:22:45,940 --> 0:22:47,950
system is that it's extremely portable

577
0:22:47,950 --> 0:22:50,529
you can see this scientist is actually

578
0:22:50,529 --> 0:22:52,269
doing some sequencing out in the field

579
0:22:52,269 --> 0:22:53,710
this looks like a jungle somewhere in

580
0:22:53,710 --> 0:22:55,149
the world you can see the foilage in the

581
0:22:55,149 --> 0:22:57,129
back so there's a laptop run to the

582
0:22:57,129 --> 0:22:59,049
sequencer and the sequencer is actually

583
0:22:59,049 --> 0:23:01,779
the small device that the scientists is

584
0:23:01,779 --> 0:23:04,450
pipetting into it's really the smize of

585
0:23:04,450 --> 0:23:06,759
of a small remote control and it's

586
0:23:06,759 --> 0:23:08,679
powered by the computer that is attached

587
0:23:08,679 --> 0:23:10,149
to you so me and so you can really take

588
0:23:10,149 --> 0:23:12,399
sequencing anywhere in the world these

589
0:23:12,399 --> 0:23:14,080
systems have even been taking up to the

590
0:23:14,080 --> 0:23:15,820
international space station for

591
0:23:15,820 --> 0:23:19,990
sequencing in space so the last

592
0:23:19,990 --> 0:23:21,340
technology i'm going to talk to you

593
0:23:21,340 --> 0:23:23,470
about today is specific bio sequencing

594
0:23:23,470 --> 0:23:25,720
and this is another sequencing by

595
0:23:25,720 --> 0:23:28,509
synthesis method and it uses building

596
0:23:28,509 --> 0:23:30,610
blocks similar to traditional saying

597
0:23:30,610 --> 0:23:31,899
your sequencing and lumina sequencing

598
0:23:31,899 --> 0:23:34,090
but they're slightly different so down

599
0:23:34,090 --> 0:23:36,610
here I'm showing you an A base from the

600
0:23:36,610 --> 0:23:39,070
Pacific bio sequencer and you'll notice

601
0:23:39,070 --> 0:23:39,759
first

602
0:23:39,759 --> 0:23:41,559
there's no block on the 3 prime hydroxyl

603
0:23:41,559 --> 0:23:43,749
n this means that once this gets

604
0:23:43,749 --> 0:23:45,820
incorporated another base can get

605
0:23:45,820 --> 0:23:48,730
incorporated right away and then the

606
0:23:48,730 --> 0:23:50,019
fluorescent group is actually attached

607
0:23:50,019 --> 0:23:53,039
to the phosphates and these phosphates

608
0:23:53,039 --> 0:23:56,440
actually are removed once a base is

609
0:23:56,440 --> 0:23:57,700
incorporated this means that this

610
0:23:57,700 --> 0:23:59,230
flourish and group once it gets

611
0:23:59,230 --> 0:24:01,240
incorporated into a DNA strand will

612
0:24:01,240 --> 0:24:03,700
float away from the DNA strand so this

613
0:24:03,700 --> 0:24:04,929
means that we don't have to do separate

614
0:24:04,929 --> 0:24:07,360
chemistry to enable the reaction to

615
0:24:07,360 --> 0:24:11,009
proceed this happens in in real time and

616
0:24:11,009 --> 0:24:14,470
on the instrument there's a really

617
0:24:14,470 --> 0:24:18,879
really tiny array of wells into in a

618
0:24:18,879 --> 0:24:21,070
plate and these wells are only about a

619
0:24:21,070 --> 0:24:23,740
hundred nanometers in height at the

620
0:24:23,740 --> 0:24:25,869
bottom of each of these wells is a DNA

621
0:24:25,869 --> 0:24:27,879
polymerase and what happens is a

622
0:24:27,879 --> 0:24:31,029
template molecule is bounded polymerase

623
0:24:31,029 --> 0:24:32,919
and then it starts incorporating this

624
0:24:32,919 --> 0:24:34,930
modified basis and there's

625
0:24:34,930 --> 0:24:36,280
camera at the bottom that's taking the

626
0:24:36,280 --> 0:24:38,350
video that's monitoring this reaction in

627
0:24:38,350 --> 0:24:41,380
real-time so remember we have four

628
0:24:41,380 --> 0:24:43,030
different bases that have four different

629
0:24:43,030 --> 0:24:45,190
colors and these bases are flowing in

630
0:24:45,190 --> 0:24:47,290
and out of this well really really

631
0:24:47,290 --> 0:24:51,190
quickly and so you get a signal that's

632
0:24:51,190 --> 0:24:53,260
just kind of very noisy you don't really

633
0:24:53,260 --> 0:24:54,880
see anything happening but when the

634
0:24:54,880 --> 0:24:57,460
proper base is bound to the plume race

635
0:24:57,460 --> 0:24:59,860
and matches the template it actually

636
0:24:59,860 --> 0:25:01,390
dwells there for a certain amount of

637
0:25:01,390 --> 0:25:03,940
time it's really a split second but that

638
0:25:03,940 --> 0:25:05,680
split second gets recorded by the video

639
0:25:05,680 --> 0:25:07,870
and you see this bump up and the

640
0:25:07,870 --> 0:25:09,720
fluorescent signal in this case blue

641
0:25:09,720 --> 0:25:12,850
which is the G base and so once the

642
0:25:12,850 --> 0:25:15,220
incorporation occurs the phosphates

643
0:25:15,220 --> 0:25:17,440
leave and the fluorescent group that

644
0:25:17,440 --> 0:25:19,030
hatch the phosphates also leaves and

645
0:25:19,030 --> 0:25:20,830
resulting in the signal dropping back

646
0:25:20,830 --> 0:25:24,070
down to this this background level and

647
0:25:24,070 --> 0:25:27,040
this will continue until the next base

648
0:25:27,040 --> 0:25:28,780
that's correct binds and you'll see

649
0:25:28,780 --> 0:25:30,970
another spike and so by looking at these

650
0:25:30,970 --> 0:25:33,250
spikes and signals across anywhere from

651
0:25:33,250 --> 0:25:35,800
one to eight million wells at a time we

652
0:25:35,800 --> 0:25:39,640
can build up DNA sequences and PacBio

653
0:25:39,640 --> 0:25:41,740
sequencing generates long reads anywhere

654
0:25:41,740 --> 0:25:44,080
from one to 200 kilobases and length so

655
0:25:44,080 --> 0:25:45,940
this is shorter than the nanopore

656
0:25:45,940 --> 0:25:47,470
sequencing but it's still much longer

657
0:25:47,470 --> 0:25:49,480
than Illumina sequencing it also has a

658
0:25:49,480 --> 0:25:52,420
high error rate similar to Oxford and a

659
0:25:52,420 --> 0:25:54,310
poor sequencing but it's errors are

660
0:25:54,310 --> 0:25:56,140
random this is actually a good thing

661
0:25:56,140 --> 0:25:57,760
because the errors are random if you

662
0:25:57,760 --> 0:25:59,560
sample the same DNA molecule several

663
0:25:59,560 --> 0:26:01,480
times you could generate a very accurate

664
0:26:01,480 --> 0:26:04,810
consensus sequence and on the top is a

665
0:26:04,810 --> 0:26:07,420
model of what a packed bio library looks

666
0:26:07,420 --> 0:26:09,790
like there's a DNA sequence and the

667
0:26:09,790 --> 0:26:11,920
adapters in green actually caused the

668
0:26:11,920 --> 0:26:13,600
DNA become this dumbbell shape so it's

669
0:26:13,600 --> 0:26:16,180
one circular structure and when the

670
0:26:16,180 --> 0:26:17,860
polymerase binds it starts a sequence

671
0:26:17,860 --> 0:26:19,570
and actually go round and round this

672
0:26:19,570 --> 0:26:21,820
molecule many many times generating a

673
0:26:21,820 --> 0:26:24,130
series of reads that are all attached

674
0:26:24,130 --> 0:26:25,480
together that came from the same

675
0:26:25,480 --> 0:26:27,760
identical template so for instance if we

676
0:26:27,760 --> 0:26:30,190
have a mutation present in a sample and

677
0:26:30,190 --> 0:26:32,950
want to detect this this mutation should

678
0:26:32,950 --> 0:26:35,080
be present in all the copies and so if

679
0:26:35,080 --> 0:26:38,290
we match up all of the different reads

680
0:26:38,290 --> 0:26:39,670
together they came from the same

681
0:26:39,670 --> 0:26:41,530
molecule we can see that the true

682
0:26:41,530 --> 0:26:43,780
mutation is actually detected we see

683
0:26:43,780 --> 0:26:46,870
that in every single read and then other

684
0:26:46,870 --> 0:26:48,860
random errors that show up

685
0:26:48,860 --> 0:26:50,929
don't match up with each other and this

686
0:26:50,929 --> 0:26:52,309
allows us to generate a very accurate

687
0:26:52,309 --> 0:26:55,130
incenses that has an accuracy of

688
0:26:55,130 --> 0:26:56,900
anywhere from one to a thousand to one

689
0:26:56,900 --> 0:26:59,330
in 10,000 actually so even exceeding a

690
0:26:59,330 --> 0:27:03,260
raw Illumina sequencing accuracy so why

691
0:27:03,260 --> 0:27:04,520
do you long reads because there are

692
0:27:04,520 --> 0:27:05,720
certain down sides they're harder to

693
0:27:05,720 --> 0:27:08,030
repair in general they cost more but

694
0:27:08,030 --> 0:27:10,340
there are certain benefits and one

695
0:27:10,340 --> 0:27:12,710
example is if you want to assemble a new

696
0:27:12,710 --> 0:27:14,830
genome that hasn't been sequences before

697
0:27:14,830 --> 0:27:17,480
and so this is kind of like solving a

698
0:27:17,480 --> 0:27:19,400
puzzle that's been either split into

699
0:27:19,400 --> 0:27
10,000 pieces or into four pieces

700
0:27 --> 0:27:23,660
Illumina sequencing and this is

701
0:27:23,660 --> 0:27:25,490
analogous to the 10,000 pieces because

702
0:27:25,490 --> 0:27:27,140
he had many many short reads that you

703
0:27:27,140 --> 0:27:28,610
have to stitch together and this can be

704
0:27:28,610 --> 0:27:30,620
very very difficult however you have

705
0:27:30,620 --> 0:27:32,660
very long reads and not that many of

706
0:27:32,660 --> 0:27:35,240
them it's really easy to align them to

707
0:27:35,240 --> 0:27:37,370
rebuild this new genome that you want to

708
0:27:37,370 --> 0:27:39,679
assemble it's also useful if you want to

709
0:27:39,679 --> 0:27:41,840
identify structural variations so for

710
0:27:41,840 --> 0:27:44,360
instance in a lot of human cancer

711
0:27:44,360 --> 0:27:47,059
samples there aren't just single based

712
0:27:47,059 --> 0:27:49,250
changes in mutations there are some that

713
0:27:49,250 --> 0:27:50,720
are structural variations where they're

714
0:27:50,720 --> 0:27:53,299
huge chunks of DNA that have been moved

715
0:27:53,299 --> 0:27:55,070
to different areas of the genome here

716
0:27:55,070 --> 0:27:57,710
there or flipped around and this can be

717
0:27:57,710 --> 0:27:59,630
very difficult to detect by short read

718
0:27:59,630 --> 0:28:00,890
Illumina sequencing but if you have

719
0:28:00,890 --> 0:28:03,559
really long read sequencing you can span

720
0:28:03,559 --> 0:28:05,809
these changes and then really easily

721
0:28:05,809 --> 0:28:08,110
identify the structural variations

722
0:28:08,110 --> 0:28:10,309
lastly you might want to identify where

723
0:28:10,309 --> 0:28:12,890
mutations come from for instance in

724
0:28:12,890 --> 0:28:14,809
humans we get one set of our chromosomes

725
0:28:14,809 --> 0:28:18,559
from mom one set from dad and there can

726
0:28:18,559 --> 0:28:20,720
be mutations on either one so nice in

727
0:28:20,720 --> 0:28:22,490
patients might be on the same set of

728
0:28:22,490 --> 0:28:25,070
chromosomes some might be on either one

729
0:28:25,070 --> 0:28:27,290
and to be able to do this with the limit

730
0:28:27,290 --> 0:28:28,760
of sequencing again is very difficult

731
0:28:28,760 --> 0:28:30,440
because the short reads make it hard to

732
0:28:30,440 --> 0:28:31,790
determine which chromosome they came

733
0:28:31,790 --> 0:28:34,280
from but with long read sequencing it's

734
0:28:34,280 --> 0:28:36,530
much easier to do so so lots of

735
0:28:36,530 --> 0:28:37,669
applications for next-generation

736
0:28:37,669 --> 0:28:39,919
sequencing I'm gonna talk about a couple

737
0:28:39,919 --> 0:28:42,530
examples one is prenatal testing this

738
0:28:42,530 --> 0:28:44,179
used to be done using a very invasive

739
0:28:44,179 --> 0:28:48,710
amniocentesis sampling which had certain

740
0:28:48,710 --> 0:28:50,360
rates of complications associated with

741
0:28:50,360 --> 0:28
it but with next-generation sequencing

742
0:28 --> 0:28:54,530
we can actually take a blood sample from

743
0:28:54,530 --> 0:28:56,540
the mom and nowhere near the fetus and

744
0:28:56,540 --> 0:28:58,490
actually sequence all the DNA that's

745
0:28:58,490 --> 0:29:00,620
present in the blood and the reason why

746
0:29:00,620 --> 0:29:02,720
this works is that fetal DNA

747
0:29:02,720 --> 0:29:05,180
actually makes its way into the mothers

748
0:29:05,180 --> 0:29:07,040
bloodstream and so we can use that to

749
0:29:07,040 --> 0:29:08,660
detect any type of chromosomal

750
0:29:08,660 --> 0:29
abnormalities in a fetus and the same

751
0:29 --> 0:29:12,860
thing happens with cancer and transplant

752
0:29:12,860 --> 0:29:15,860
rejection patients so in cancer the

753
0:29:15,860 --> 0:29:17,420
cancer cells are constantly shedding

754
0:29:17,420 --> 0:29:19,160
their DNA out into the bloodstream and

755
0:29:19,160 --> 0:29:21,290
because the Chancellor genome is going

756
0:29:21,290 --> 0:29:23,210
to be slightly different than the normal

757
0:29:23,210 --> 0:29:24,740
genome we can identify those through

758
0:29:24,740 --> 0:29:26,510
sequencing and same thing with

759
0:29:26,510 --> 0:29:29,030
transplant rejection if a donated hearts

760
0:29:29,030 --> 0:29:31,820
for instance is undergoing rejection its

761
0:29:31,820 --> 0:29:33,500
cells are dying and shedding DNA and

762
0:29:33,500 --> 0:29:35,720
those donor DNA sequences are very

763
0:29:35,720 --> 0:29:37,400
different from the recipients DNA

764
0:29:37,400 --> 0:29:39,410
sequences and we can detect that by

765
0:29:39,410 --> 0:29:42,140
sequencing that material another example

766
0:29:42,140 --> 0:29:44,210
of using a next-gen sequencing is to

767
0:29:44,210 --> 0:29:46,250
detect pathogens pathogens have their

768
0:29:46,250 --> 0:29:48,500
own set of DNA and RNA that are very

769
0:29:48,500 --> 0:29:50,270
different from human sequences and so if

770
0:29:50,270 --> 0:29:52,100
there's a pathogen present in a human

771
0:29:52,100 --> 0:29:54,740
sample we can sequence this human sample

772
0:29:54,740 --> 0:29:57,170
ignore all the reads or the sequences

773
0:29:57,170 --> 0:29:59,080
that are human and asked what's left and

774
0:29:59,080 --> 0:30:01,190
typically if there's a pathogen present

775
0:30:01,190 --> 0:30:04,280
we'll be able to detect its sequence in

776
0:30:04,280 --> 0:30:07,670
that sample and lastly in the context of

777
0:30:07,670 --> 0:30:09,950
cancer treatment cancer again is driven

778
0:30:09,950 --> 0:30:11,930
by mutations and there are lots of

779
0:30:11,930 --> 0:30:13,850
different therapies for cancer but

780
0:30:13,850 --> 0:30:15,020
they're very specific for certain

781
0:30:15,020 --> 0:30:17,630
cancers and so by doing next-generation

782
0:30:17,630 --> 0:30:20,420
sequencing on cancer samples we can

783
0:30:20,420 --> 0:30:22,100
determine the best types of treatments

784
0:30:22,100 --> 0:30:25,450
for patients and improve their outcomes

785
0:30:25,450 --> 0:30:27,890
so the future of sequencing is very

786
0:30:27,890 --> 0:30:29,210
exciting currently it's a thousand

787
0:30:29,210 --> 0:30:30,860
dollars to sequence a genome but in the

788
0:30:30,860 --> 0:30:32,360
next five or ten years so the cost will

789
0:30:32,360 --> 0:30:33,950
probably come down to a hundred dollars

790
0:30:33,950 --> 0:30:36,020
and it'll be interesting to see what

791
0:30:36,020 --> 0:30:37,850
happens when let's this cost is reached

792
0:30:37,850 --> 0:30:40,130
for instance well genome sequence just

793
0:30:40,130 --> 0:30:41,780
become a routine part of your medical

794
0:30:41,780 --> 0:30:43,970
record and if so this would be a great

795
0:30:43,970 --> 0:30:45,530
resource for researchers trying to study

796
0:30:45,530 --> 0:30:47,960
genetic diseases but at the same point

797
0:30:47,960 --> 0:30:50,150
you have to understand and figure out

798
0:30:50,150 --> 0:30:52,970
ways of protecting patients genetic

799
0:30:52,970 --> 0:30:54,730
information if all of this is out there

800
0:30:54,730 --> 0:30:56,840
but it's going to be very exciting to

801
0:30:56,840 --> 0:30:58,820
see where what new applications are

802
0:30:58,820 --> 0:31:01,190
developed for next-gen sequencing as the

803
0:31:01,190 --> 0:31:04,450
technology continues to develop a mature

804
0:31:04,450 --> 0:31:06,710
that I'd like to thank you for watching

805
0:31:06,710 --> 0:31:15,850
and joining us today

806
0:31:15,850 --> 0:31:17,910
