2
0:00:09,679 --> 0:00:12,480
the main task of an appellate judge

3
0:00:12,480 --> 0:00:15,360
is to interpret and understand the

4
0:00:15,360 --> 0:00:18,480
meaning of language it might be in a

5
0:00:18,480 --> 0:00:20,560
contract in a statute in the

6
0:00:20,560 --> 0:00:21,920
constitution

7
0:00:21,920 --> 0:00:24,080
in public law or in private law

8
0:00:24,080 --> 0:00:26,880
a key starting question for the problem

9
0:00:26,880 --> 0:00:28,960
of interpretation is to find the

10
0:00:28,960 --> 0:00
ordinary meaning of language the corpus

11
0:00 --> 0:00:34,960
linguistics project which includes

12
0:00:34,960 --> 0:00:37,280
academic writing and now a growing body

13
0:00:37,280 --> 0:00:38,079
of

14
0:00:38,079 --> 0:00:39,760
judicial opinions

15
0:00:39,760 --> 0:00:41,600
identifies some

16
0:00:41,600 --> 0:00:44,559
serious shortcomings with the way that

17
0:00:44,559 --> 0:00:45,680
the law

18
0:00:45,680 --> 0:00:47,600
the way that judges and lawyers have

19
0:00:47,600 --> 0:00:49,920
been approaching the problem of ordinary

20
0:00:49,920 --> 0:00:53,199
meaning the idea of corpus linguistics

21
0:00:53,199 --> 0:00:55,680
is the idea that language patterns and

22
0:00:55,680 --> 0:00:59,039
language usage can be derived from large

23
0:00:59,039 --> 0:01:01,600
bodies of naturally occurring language

24
0:01:01,600 --> 0:01:04,159
so a corpus is just a body of language

25
0:01:04,159 --> 0:01:06,080
and corpus linguistics is simply the

26
0:01:06,080 --> 0:01:09,360
study of language using large bodies of

27
0:01:09,360 --> 0:01:11,520
naturally occurring language a simple

28
0:01:11,520 --> 0:01
westlaw search or alexa search could be

29
0:01 --> 0:01:16,799
understood as a corpus search a corpus

30
0:01:16,799 --> 0:01:18,799
analysis if you're trying to find the

31
0:01:18,799 --> 0:01:20,640
way that a word is used in a body of

32
0:01:20,640 --> 0:01:23,200
case law that body of case law would be

33
0:01:23,200 --> 0:01:25,920
a corpus but the the broader idea of

34
0:01:25,920 --> 0:01:28,640
corpus linguistic analysis of law is if

35
0:01:28,640 --> 0:01:30,960
you're trying to understand the meaning

36
0:01:30,960 --> 0:01:33,520
of words more generally in our broader

37
0:01:33,520 --> 0:01:36,400
society it identifies problems with

38
0:01:36,400 --> 0:01:38,640
relying on dictionaries it identifies

39
0:01:38,640 --> 0:01:41,040
problems with relying on the etymology

40
0:01:41,040 --> 0:01:44,399
of a word and it even suggests that a

41
0:01:44,399 --> 0:01:46,479
judge falling back on his or her

42
0:01:46,479 --> 0:01:48,560
intuition with respect to the meaning of

43
0:01:48,560 --> 0:01:50,880
a word is fraud and fraud at a minimum

44
0:01:50,880 --> 0:01:53,680
with a risk of confirmation bias and

45
0:01:53,680 --> 0:01:55,280
motivated reasoning

46
0:01:55,280 --> 0:01:57,920
it also points out the idea that the

47
0:01:57,920 --> 0:02:00,560
ordinary meaning inquiry is an empirical

48
0:02:00,560 --> 0:02:03,280
inquiry and it suggests that especially

49
0:02:03,280 --> 0:02:05,840
in this age of information empirical

50
0:02:05,840 --> 0:02:08,319
inquiries should be answered using data

51
0:02:08,319 --> 0:02:10,560
we now have available to us a set of

52
0:02:10,560 --> 0:02:12,959
tools a set of principles and theories

53
0:02:12,959 --> 0:02:14,879
developed in the field of linguistics

54
0:02:14,879 --> 0:02:17,120
specifically by corpus linguists that

55
0:02:17,120 --> 0:02:19,599
can give us data and allow us to address

56
0:02:19,599 --> 0:02:21,920
the shortcomings of traditional methods

57
0:02:21,920 --> 0:02:24,080
of trying to find the ordinary meaning

58
0:02:24,080 --> 0:02:25,680
of the words of the law

59
0:02:25,680 --> 0:02:28,239
the tools of corpus linguistics can be

60
0:02:28,239 --> 0:02:30,800
employed with respect to any question of

61
0:02:30,800 --> 0:02:33,920
ordinary meaning that might arise in the

62
0:02:33,920 --> 0:02:36,400
language of the law in some sense it may

63
0:02:36,400 --> 0:02:38,800
seem most significant to

64
0:02:38,800 --> 0:02:41,040
utilize these tools with respect to

65
0:02:41,040 --> 0:02:43,120
historical questions of meaning it may

66
0:02:43,120 --> 0:02:45,519
be most important in the following sense

67
0:02:45,519 --> 0:02:47,840
linguists have made the observation that

68
0:02:47,840 --> 0:02:49,599
our language is always in a state of

69
0:02:49,599 --> 0:02:50,640
change

70
0:02:50,640 --> 0:02:52,800
we talk about the problem of linguistic

71
0:02:52,800 --> 0:02:56,400
drift or semantic shift the english that

72
0:02:56,400 --> 0:02:59,280
was spoken in the 18th century during

73
0:02:59,280 --> 0:03:00,720
the period of the founding is more

74
0:03:00,720 --> 0:03:02,879
foreign to me i have some understanding

75
0:03:02,879 --> 0:03:04,480
of it because i've read some historical

76
0:03:04,480 --> 0:03:06,400
documents and historical materials but

77
0:03:06,400 --> 0:03:09,360
it's very important that because my

78
0:03:09,360 --> 0:03:11,519
intuition doesn't take me back to that

79
0:03:11,519 --> 0:03:13,519
era it's very important to have access

80
0:03:13,519 --> 0:03:15,840
to corpus tools that are historically

81
0:03:15,840 --> 0:03:18,480
based one of the big advantages to

82
0:03:18,480 --> 0:03:20,560
corpus linguistic analysis to what it

83
0:03:20,560 --> 0:03:23,280
gives us over traditional existing tools

84
0:03:23,280 --> 0:03:25,920
of interpretation is its transparency

85
0:03:25,920 --> 0:03:28,879
and that it is giving us data that give

86
0:03:28,879 --> 0:03:31,599
rise to the possibility of falsification

87
0:03:31,599 --> 0:03:33,760
or verification by someone else in this

88
0:03:33,760 --> 0:03:35,920
sense it is more scientific it is more

89
0:03:35,920 --> 0:03:38,720
data-driven and data-based to me it's an

90
0:03:38,720 --> 0:03:40,879
embarrassment that we don't have a field

91
0:03:40,879 --> 0:03:42,799
called law and linguistics it's an

92
0:03:42,799 --> 0:03:44,959
embarrassment in that the very thing

93
0:03:44,959 --> 0:03:47,040
that we judges do the most at least

94
0:03:47,040 --> 0:03:48,879
appellate judges do the most which is to

95
0:03:48,879 --> 0:03:50,959
try to disambiguate the meaning of

96
0:03:50,959 --> 0:03
language is a problem that an entire

97
0:03 --> 0:03:56,959
field has devoted its academic life to

98
0:03:56,959 --> 0:03:58,940
the field of linguistics
