0:00:08,240 --> 0:00:10,800
I'm Rita Hana and I'm part of the

3
0:00:10,800 --> 0:00:13,259
orangey DNA pipelines team here at the

4
0:00:13,259 --> 0:00:16,830
Sanger Institute my job is to test and

5
0:00:16,830 --> 0:00:20,210
develop new methods to sequence DNA a

6
0:00:20,210 --> 0:00:24,210
DNA pipeline is the process of taking

7
0:00:24,210 --> 0:00:26,670
DNA samples preparing them for

8
0:00:26,670 --> 0:00:29,130
sequencing and sequencing them before

9
0:00:29,130 --> 0:00:31,279
releasing the data to the researcher

10
0:00:31,279 --> 0:00:33,960
because we work with DNA samples and

11
0:00:33,960 --> 0:00:35,700
sometimes those samples have very low

12
0:00:35,700 --> 0:00:37,800
amount of DNA we need to make sure that

13
0:00:37,800 --> 0:00:39,840
we will never contaminate them with our

14
0:00:39,840 --> 0:00:41,969
own DNA and that's why we wear lab coats

15
0:00:41,969 --> 0:00:44,760
and gloves all the time we receive the

16
0:00:44,760 --> 0:00:47,760
samples in 96-well plates and I've

17
0:00:47,760 --> 0:00:50,039
already been extracted and purified from

18
0:00:50,039 --> 0:00:53,370
cell tissue or blood when we receive

19
0:00:53,370 --> 0:00:54,780
those samples we need to check the

20
0:00:54,780 --> 0:00:56,579
quality of the DNA to check that it's

21
0:00:56,579 --> 0:00:59,309
still very long strength of genomic DNA

22
0:00:59,309 --> 0:01:01,680
that's what we call the quality control

23
0:01:01,680 --> 0:01:04,530
or QC step we really don't want to waste

24
0:01:04,530 --> 0:01:06,930
a lot of the sample for quality control

25
0:01:06,930 --> 0:01:09,330
that's why we are using the mosquito

26
0:01:09,330 --> 0:01:11,700
robots for that step because it's able

27
0:01:11,700 --> 0:01:15,960
to be pet only nanoliters of DNA these

28
0:01:15,960 --> 0:01:18,600
nano liters of DNA pitted by the robot

29
0:01:18,600 --> 0:01:20,790
are then mixed with a solution

30
0:01:20,790 --> 0:01:23,369
containing a fluorescent dye these

31
0:01:23,369 --> 0:01:25,799
molecules of dye grow very very bright

32
0:01:25,799 --> 0:01:28,470
only when they touch DNA so we can

33
0:01:28,470 --> 0:01:31,200
relate the level of fluorescence with

34
0:01:31,200 --> 0:01:33,329
the actual concentration of DNA in the

35
0:01:33,329 --> 0:01:35,729
sample then when we are sure that how

36
0:01:35,729 --> 0:01:38,250
DNA is of good quality and in good

37
0:01:38,250 --> 0:01:40,020
amounts we start the library

38
0:01:40,020 --> 0:01:42,630
construction itself this take place in

39
0:01:42,630 --> 0:01:46,020
our pre PCL lab on the Bravo robots the

40
0:01:46,020 --> 0:01:49,290
Bravo robot will be able to peep at some

41
0:01:49,290 --> 0:01:51,509
solution containing what we call

42
0:01:51,509 --> 0:01:54,390
adapters those adapters are very short

43
0:01:54,390 --> 0:01:56,729
fragment of DNA that get attached or

44
0:01:56,729 --> 0:02:00,090
ligated to the end of audio samples the

45
0:02:00,090 --> 0:02:02,250
adapters have two goals they will load

46
0:02:02,250 --> 0:02:04,320
the sample to attach at the surface of

47
0:02:04,320 --> 0:02:06,960
the flow cell and they also contain a

48
0:02:06,960 --> 0:02:09,750
tag that will be part of our sequencing

49
0:02:09,750 --> 0:02:11,980
data and with all of us to

50
0:02:11,980 --> 0:02:14,890
know which fragments of DNA came from

51
0:02:14,890 --> 0:02:17,800
which sample because we process such a

52
0:02:17,800 --> 0:02:20,290
high number of samples we need to make

53
0:02:20,290 --> 0:02:22,660
sure that we never exchange them or lose

54
0:02:22,660 --> 0:02:24,760
them and that's why we use barcodes on

55
0:02:24,760 --> 0:02:28,060
each of our plates we have a process

56
0:02:28,060 --> 0:02:30,550
called limbs for laboratory information

57
0:02:30,550 --> 0:02:33,880
management system which allow us to scan

58
0:02:33,880 --> 0:02:36,220
all those barcodes and track the samples

59
0:02:36,220 --> 0:02:38,200
all along the library preparation

60
0:02:38,200 --> 0:02:41,560
process after attaching the adapters to

61
0:02:41,560 --> 0:02:44,830
a DNA fragment we take the samples off

62
0:02:44,830 --> 0:02:48,610
the robot deck onto a bench because we

63
0:02:48,610 --> 0:02:50,709
are sharing those benches with a lot of

64
0:02:50,709 --> 0:02:52,510
people in the lab they need to remain

65
0:02:52,510 --> 0:02:55,599
very tidy and clean so we have divided

66
0:02:55,599 --> 0:02
the space with tape and labels so that

67
0:02 --> 0:03:00,579
we know exactly where things are the

68
0:03:00,579 --> 0:03:02,290
samples are now ready for PCR

69
0:03:02,290 --> 0:03:05,380
amplification and during this process we

70
0:03:05,380 --> 0:03:07,450
have to heat the sample to high

71
0:03:07,450 --> 0:03:10,720
temperature to avoid evaporation we seal

72
0:03:10,720 --> 0:03:14,110
the plates with a very tight seal PCR

73
0:03:14,110 --> 0:03:16,060
amplification has to be done in a

74
0:03:16,060 --> 0:03:17,500
different lab to avoid

75
0:03:17,500 --> 0:03:20,170
cross-contamination and we pass the

76
0:03:20,170 --> 0:03:22,480
sample through a special hatch between

77
0:03:22,480 --> 0:03:25,660
those two labs each lab has different

78
0:03:25,660 --> 0:03:27,790
colors of lab coats to make sure that we

79
0:03:27,790 --> 0:03:29,739
are not contaminating samples between

80
0:03:29,739 --> 0:03:32,440
the labs we then take the samples and

81
0:03:32,440 --> 0:03:35,019
put them in a PCR machine that is able

82
0:03:35,019 --> 0:03:38,109
to amplify the DNA the DNA samples are

83
0:03:38,109 --> 0:03:41,109
now ready for sequencing and in order to

84
0:03:41,109 --> 0:03:42,970
be loaded on the sequencer we need to

85
0:03:42,970 --> 0:03:45,220
remove the seal now that's quite a

86
0:03:45,220 --> 0:03:47,079
tricky step despite the fact that it

87
0:03:47,079 --> 0:03:49,209
looks very simple and no robots can do

88
0:03:49,209 --> 0:03:51,660
it it has to be done by hand to avoid

89
0:03:51,660 --> 0:03:54,340
splashes between the samples which would

90
0:03:54,340 --> 0:03:57,670
lead to cross-contamination the samples

91
0:03:57,670 --> 0:03:59,859
are then put on a flow cell loaded on

92
0:03:59,859 --> 0:04:02,170
the sequencer and the sequencing run can

93
0:04:02,170 --> 0:04:03,299
start

94
0:04:03,299 --> 0:04:06,640
during a run we can check on the monitor

95
0:04:06,640 --> 0:04:09,280
of each sequencer the quality of the

96
0:04:09,280 --> 0:04:11,110
data being created and check that

97
0:04:11,110 --> 0:04:12,760
everything is working fine on the

98
0:04:12,760 --> 0:04:14,920
sequencer when a sequencing run is

99
0:04:14,920 --> 0:04:16,870
finished the data is transferred to a

100
0:04:16,870 --> 0:04:19,780
data center which is a huge cluster of

101
0:04:19,780 --> 0:04:22,900
computers the last stage for pipelines

102
0:04:22,900 --> 0:04:24,820
team is to check that we have produced

103
0:04:24,820 --> 0:04:27,970
enough data and of good quality and when

104
0:04:27,970 --> 0:04:30,610
that last check is done the researchers

105
0:04:30,610 --> 0:04:32,199
that have initially requested the

106
0:04:32,199 --> 0:04:34,240
sequencing are able to access the data

107
0:04:34,240 --> 0:04:37,720
in the cluster I really like working in

108
0:04:37,720 --> 0:04:40,630
the DNA pipelines because it use a lot

109
0:04:40,630 --> 0:04:43,630
of different skills I studied chemistry

110
0:04:43,630 --> 0:04:46,720
and then I work in a biophysics lab so

111
0:04:46,720 --> 0:04:48,940
that's why I particularly like it it's

112
0:04:48,940 --> 0:04:52,030
always exciting and never boring

113
0:04:52,030 --> 0:04:52,360
[Applause]

114
0:04:52,360 --> 0:05:04,050

115
0:05:04,050 --> 0:05:06,110
