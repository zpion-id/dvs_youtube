1
0:00:08,269 --> 0:00:11,639
when the transistor arguably the most

2
0:00:11,639 --> 0:00:14,490
important invention of the 20th century

3
0:00:14,490 --> 0:00:17,039
was invented at Bell Labs at the tail

4
0:00:17,039 --> 0:00:20,730
end of 1947 there was one problem that

5
0:00:20,730 --> 0:00:24,240
remained unsolved what to call such an

6
0:00:24,240 --> 0:00:26,880
important device though members of the

7
0:00:26,880 --> 0:00:29,610
lab staff were aware of the transistors

8
0:00:29,610 --> 0:00:32,399
existence it would be months before the

9
0:00:32,399 --> 0:00:33,629
public would hear of it

10
0:00:33,629 --> 0:00:35,820
that would happen when the patents were

11
0:00:35,820 --> 0:00:38,039
filed and the press materials released

12
0:00:38,039 --> 0:00:41,399
as the day drew closer it became

13
0:00:41,399 --> 0:00:43,710
increasingly clear that this particular

14
0:00:43,710 --> 0:00:48,059
invention really needed a great name the

15
0:00:48,059 --> 0:00:49,649
descriptive terms that were floating

16
0:00:49,649 --> 0:00:51,929
around the labs like semiconductor

17
0:00:51,929 --> 0:00:55,979
triode or surface States amplifier just

18
0:00:55,979 --> 0:00:58,620
wouldn't cut it one of the devices

19
0:00:58,620 --> 0:01:00,569
inventors Walter Brattain

20
0:01:00,569 --> 0:01:02,699
asked his friend and fellow lab

21
0:01:02,699 --> 0:01:05,759
scientist John our peers what he thought

22
0:01:05,759 --> 0:01:08,420
it should be called Pierce came up with

23
0:01:08,420 --> 0:01:12,200
transistor based on the root concepts of

24
0:01:12,200 --> 0:01:15,229
transconductance and variable resistance

25
0:01:15,229 --> 0:01:17,729
the final decision will be made by

26
0:01:17,729 --> 0:01:20,369
committee but the committee was stumped

27
0:01:20,369 --> 0:01:22,649
it failed to reach a unanimous decision

28
0:01:22,649 --> 0:01:26,850
in a somewhat unusual move the name was

29
0:01:26,850 --> 0:01:29,549
opened up to a vote engineers at the

30
0:01:29,549 --> 0:01:31,710
labs received a ballot with names like

31
0:01:31,710 --> 0:01:36,060
iota Tron and crystal triode included on

32
0:01:36,060 --> 0:01:38,490
the list was Pierce's proposal the

33
0:01:38,490 --> 0:01:41,899
transistor it won by a landslide

34
0:01:41,899 --> 0:01:50,719
now here's genesis of the transistor

35
0:01:50,719 --> 0:01:55,750
ever assembled the year 1947

36
0:01:55,750 --> 0:01:57,670
and this is one of the latest

37
0:01:57,670 --> 0:01:59,560
transistors a much more sophisticated

38
0:01:59,560 --> 0:02:02,080
device but based on the same physical

39
0:02:02,080 --> 0:02:10,750
principles as its ancestor the impact of

40
0:02:10,750 --> 0:02:12,250
the transistor on the electronic

41
0:02:12,250 --> 0:02:15,370
industry and on our society is

42
0:02:15,370 --> 0:02:41,530
unquestioned

43
0:02:41,530 --> 0:02:44,239
what is the origin of this remarkable

44
0:02:44,239 --> 0:03:05,300
device

45
0:03:05,300 --> 0:03:08,070
the discovery of the transistor is the

46
0:03:08,070 --> 0:03:12,570
result of scientific research research

47
0:03:12,570 --> 0:03:15,990
by men of insight who sought to

48
0:03:15,990 --> 0:03:18,300
understand the atomic structure and

49
0:03:18,300 --> 0:03:20,310
electrical behavior of semiconductors

50
0:03:20,310 --> 0:03:23,390
which had intrigued them for years

51
0:03:23,390 --> 0:03:26,610
for example electrical conductivity of

52
0:03:26,610 --> 0:03:33,540
semiconductors like germanium lie

53
0:03:33,540 --> 0:03:35,160
somewhere between that of good

54
0:03:35,160 --> 0:03:40,110
conductors like copper and good

55
0:03:40,110 --> 0:03:46,380
insulators like rubber conductivity of

56
0:03:46,380 --> 0:03:48,360
semiconductors increases when their

57
0:03:48,360 --> 0:03:54,690
temperature is raised conductivity of

58
0:03:54,690 --> 0:04:06,410
metals decreases when they are heated

59
0:04:06,410 --> 0:04:08,720
conductivity of most semiconductors like

60
0:04:08,720 --> 0:04:13,940
germanium increases when they are

61
0:04:13,940 --> 0:04:21,980
exposed to light

62
0:04:21,980 --> 0:04:24,560
and when a metal like this copper wire

63
0:04:24,560 --> 0:04:27,020
is in contact with a semiconductor in

64
0:04:27,020 --> 0:04:29,050
this case a piece of germanium

65
0:04:29,050 --> 0:04:35,230
conductivity is less in one direction

66
0:04:35,230 --> 0:04:42,760
than the other

67
0:04:42,760 --> 0:04:45,160
this characteristic of semiconductors

68
0:04:45,160 --> 0:04:47,350
was exploited in the early days of radio

69
0:04:47,350 --> 0:04:50,440
to make excellent radio detectors using

70
0:04:50,440 --> 0:04:54,310
lead sulphide or silicon when these

71
0:04:54,310 --> 0:04:56,380
semiconductors were touched with a fine

72
0:04:56,380 --> 0:04:59,710
wire called a cat's whisker they changed

73
0:04:59,710 --> 0:05:02,350
the incoming high-frequency signal to a

74
0:05:02,350 --> 0:05:04,720
low frequency signal which could then be

75
0:05:04,720 --> 0:05:10,590
heard with earphones

76
0:05:10,590 --> 0:05:13,230
later semiconductors were used to build

77
0:05:13,230 --> 0:05:15,690
devices like this copper oxide rectifier

78
0:05:15,690 --> 0:05:19,850
for telephone systems

79
0:05:19,850 --> 0:05:24,020
and cat's whisker rectifiers were

80
0:05:24,020 --> 0:05:26,300
reactivated during World War two

81
0:05:26,300 --> 0:05:35,610
for microwave radar

82
0:05:35,610 --> 0:05:38,110
even though semiconductors were being

83
0:05:38,110 --> 0:05:41,440
used they were not fully understood thus

84
0:05:41,440 --> 0:05
after the war Bell Telephone

85
0:05 --> 0:05:45,220
laboratories intensified the

86
0:05:45,220 --> 0:05:47,590
investigation of semiconductors with a

87
0:05:47,590 --> 0:05:53,920
hope for understanding understanding

88
0:05:53,920 --> 0:05:57,910
might bring control and control was the

89
0:05:57,910 --> 0:06:02,370
key to further use Bell Laboratories

90
0:06:02,370 --> 0:06:05,200
scientists decided to study silicon and

91
0:06:05,200 --> 0:06:06,880
germanium which are the simplest

92
0:06:06,880 --> 0:06:12,280
semiconductors the work proceeded in two

93
0:06:12,280 --> 0:06:15,960
areas the studies of bulk properties and

94
0:06:15,960 --> 0:06:21,850
surface properties at a very early stage

95
0:06:21,850 --> 0:06:23,920
of the investigation William Shockley

96
0:06:23,920 --> 0:06:25,990
predicted from existing theories of

97
0:06:25,990 --> 0:06:27,660
electrical conduction in semiconductors

98
0:06:27,660 --> 0:06:30,100
that it should be possible to control

99
0:06:30,100 --> 0:06:32,320
the supply of electrons near the surface

100
0:06:32,320 --> 0:06:34,840
of a semiconductor by influencing them

101
0:06:34,840 --> 0:06:37,450
with an electric field imposed from the

102
0:06:37,450 --> 0:06:41,200
outside if true this might lead to a new

103
0:06:41,200 --> 0:06:43,990
amplifier without the limitations of the

104
0:06:43,990 --> 0:06:48,250
electron to Shockley devised some

105
0:06:48,250 --> 0:06:50,860
experiments to test his hypothesis but

106
0:06:50,860 --> 0:06:52,750
was unable to secure satisfactory

107
0:06:52,750 --> 0:06:58,060
results the negative result of the field

108
0:06:58,060 --> 0:07:00,430
effect experiments was an important

109
0:07:00,430 --> 0:07:02,620
factor in suggesting to John Bardeen

110
0:07:02,620 --> 0:07:05,080
that electrons were trapped in the

111
0:07:05,080 --> 0:07:12,880
surface of the semiconductor this theory

112
0:07:12,880 --> 0:07:15,550
suggested new experiments which Walter

113
0:07:15,550 --> 0:07:18,640
Brattain carried out recently dr.

114
0:07:18,640 --> 0:07:20,140
Bratton describes some of the

115
0:07:20,140 --> 0:07:22,810
experiments one of the types of

116
0:07:22,810 --> 0:07:27,970
measurements that was being done was to

117
0:07:27,970 --> 0:07:30,820
measure the contact potential of the

118
0:07:30,820 --> 0:07:37,410
surface of germanium one did this and

119
0:07:37,410 --> 0:07:40,960
after the fashion of the first

120
0:07:40,960 --> 0:07:42,970
experiment on contact potential by

121
0:07:42,970 --> 0:07:49,080
kelvin by having a semiconductor surface

122
0:07:49,080 --> 0:07:51,520
whether electrical contact or

123
0:07:51,520 --> 0:07:53,650
semiconductor placing close to the

124
0:07:53,650 --> 0:08:03,880
semiconductor a a metal conductor if one

125
0:08:03,880 --> 0:08:05,830
moved the metal conductor with respect

126
0:08:05,830 --> 0:08:08,170
to the semiconductor when a general got

127
0:08:08,170 --> 0:08:13,540
current flow in the external circuit but

128
0:08:13,540 --> 0:08:16,570
one found as Kelvin did that if one put

129
0:08:16,570 --> 0:08:20,710
in a battery of the proper amount one

130
0:08:20,710 --> 0:08:24,700
could move that one the metal with

131
0:08:24,700 --> 0:08:26,800
respect to semiconductor without getting

132
0:08:26,800 --> 0:08:30,510
any current in studying this effect it

133
0:08:30,510 --> 0:08:34,840
we decided at one time to see if we

134
0:08:34,840 --> 0:08:37,300
could do this when the whole system was

135
0:08:37,300 --> 0:08:42,300
immersed in electric the phenomena that

136
0:08:42,300 --> 0:08:48,640
resulted were very interesting and we

137
0:08:48,640 --> 0:08:51,310
finally decided that by using

138
0:08:51,310 --> 0:08:54,040
electrolyte one should be able to make

139
0:08:54,040 --> 0:08:57,490
intense ball an amplifier out of a

140
0:08:57,490 --> 0:09:02,339
semiconductor one morning after we had

141
0:09:02,339 --> 0:09:05,410
discussed the results of this type of

142
0:09:05,410 --> 0:09:08,470
experiment john bardeen walked into my

143
0:09:08,470 --> 0:09:11,910
office and suggested a geometry for a

144
0:09:11,910 --> 0:09:15,490
producing an amplifier using the

145
0:09:15,490 --> 0:09:20,140
electrolyte Bardeen suggested that on a

146
0:09:20,140 --> 0:09:22,240
piece of germanium they place a drop of

147
0:09:22,240 --> 0:09:27,520
electrolyte in this case water then to

148
0:09:27,520 --> 0:09:29,500
wax a metal wire and push it through the

149
0:09:29,500 --> 0:09:32,940
water to make contact with the germanium

150
0:09:32,940 --> 0:09:35,620
the wax would insulate the wire from the

151
0:09:35,620 --> 0:09:38,550
water

152
0:09:38,550 --> 0:09:41,110
another point would make contact with

153
0:09:41,110 --> 0:09:45,040
the water potentials would be supplied

154
0:09:45,040 --> 0:09:46,900
between the water and the germanium and

155
0:09:46,900 --> 0:09:49,180
also between the wax point and the

156
0:09:49,180 --> 0:09:51,820
germanium it was thought that the

157
0:09:51,820 --> 0:09:53,710
potential on the electrolyte would

158
0:09:53,710 --> 0:09:55,390
influence the flow of current between

159
0:09:55,390 --> 0:10:02,650
the wax point and the germanium

160
0:10:02,650 --> 0:10:06,620
this experiment worked they had produced

161
0:10:06,620 --> 0:10:11,090
a semiconductor amplifier this

162
0:10:11,090 --> 0:10:13,490
experiment was the key that led to the

163
0:10:13,490 --> 0:10:18,410
invention of the transistor but there

164
0:10:18,410 --> 0:10:21,280
were several problems the water

165
0:10:21,280 --> 0:10:27,320
evaporated too quickly so they changed

166
0:10:27,320 --> 0:10:29,870
the electrolyte to glycol borate which

167
0:10:29,870 --> 0:10:33,500
evaporates very slowly this worked quite

168
0:10:33,500 --> 0:10:36,860
well but the device would not amplify

169
0:10:36,860 --> 0:10:39,860
above eight cycles per second they were

170
0:10:39,860 --> 0:10:41,660
quite sure that the electrolyte was

171
0:10:41,660 --> 0:10:44,870
responsible for the slow response they

172
0:10:44,870 --> 0:10:46,580
tried to replace the electrolyte and

173
0:10:46,580 --> 0:10:51,050
it's contact with a spot of gold instead

174
0:10:51,050 --> 0:10:52,820
of the wax point they placed a wire

175
0:10:52,820 --> 0:11:02,029
contact near the edge of the gold spot

176
0:11:02,029 --> 0:11:04,919
it was then they observed an entirely

177
0:11:04,919 --> 0:11:08,909
new phenomenon now called the transistor

178
0:11:08,909 --> 0:11:13,399
effect four days later on December 23rd

179
0:11:13,399 --> 0:11:17,279
1947 utilizing the transistor effect the

180
0:11:17,279 --> 0:11:20,489
very first transistor was made this was

181
0:11:20,489 --> 0:11:22,739
an eventful day and Walter Brattain

182
0:11:22,739 --> 0:11:27,749
recorded the events my notes for the day

183
0:11:27,749 --> 0:11:32,999
say this using the germanium surface see

184
0:11:32,999 --> 0:11:36,989
top of page 197 and the gold contacts

185
0:11:36,989 --> 0:11:40,379
the following circuit was set up this

186
0:11:40,379 --> 0:11:43,259
circuit was actually spoken over and by

187
0:11:43,259 --> 0:11:45,689
switching the device in and out

188
0:11:45,689 --> 0:11:48,119
they distinct gain and speech level

189
0:11:48,119 --> 0:11:51,659
could be heard and seen on the scope

190
0:11:51,659 --> 0:11:54,359
presentation with no noticeable change

191
0:11:54,359 --> 0:11:57,359
in quality by measurements at a fixed

192
0:11:57,359 --> 0:11:59,699
frequency it was determined that the

193
0:11:59,699 --> 0:12:02,489
power gain was of the order of a factor

194
0:12:02,489 --> 0:12:05,849
of 18 or greater various people were

195
0:12:05,849 --> 0:12:09,659
present and witnessed this test and

196
0:12:09,659 --> 0:12:12,779

0:12:28,799 --> 0:12:31,019
the demonstration occurred on the

202
0:12:31,019 --> 0:12:37,940
afternoon of December 23rd 1947

203
0:12:37,940 --> 0:12:40,370
the question in everyone's mind at the

204
0:12:40,370 --> 0:12:43,490
time was could this embryo amplifier be

205
0:12:43,490 --> 0:12:46,790
the hope for prize or was it merely an

206
0:12:46,790 --> 0:12:49,880
erratic laboratory curiosity could it be

207
0:12:49,880 --> 0:12:52,630
made into a thoroughly practical device

208
0:12:52,630 --> 0:12:55,100
this challenge was taken up by the

209
0:12:55,100 --> 0:12:57,920
design and development group this new

210
0:12:57,920 --> 0:12:59,800
device had to meet extended performance

211
0:12:59,800 --> 0:13:03,080
requirements be reliable and yet be

212
0:13:03,080 --> 0:13:05,900
economically feasible to produce the

213
0:13:05,900 --> 0:13
point-contact transistor was the first

214
0:13 --> 0:13:10,460
production line model further

215
0:13:10,460 --> 0:13:12,860
understanding and control led to the

216
0:13:12,860 --> 0:13:15,140
growing of single crystals of germanium

217
0:13:15,140 --> 0:13:17,630
and made possible William Shockley's

218
0:13:17,630 --> 0:13:21,080
concept of a junction transistor this

219
0:13:21,080 --> 0:13:26,210
was in 1951 a few years later the alloy

220
0:13:26,210 --> 0:13:29,090
transistor was developed the industry

221
0:13:29,090 --> 0:13:31,040
was now in a period of substantial

222
0:13:31,040 --> 0:13:34,430
growth but more work lay ahead the

223
0:13:34,430 --> 0:13:36,470
frequency of the alloy transistor was

224
0:13:36,470 --> 0:13:38,660
definitely limited and it could only be

225
0:13:38,660 --> 0:13:50,060
produced on a one-at-a-time basis

226
0:13:50,060 --> 0:13:53,660
now came another breakthrough the

227
0:13:53,660 --> 0:13:56,420
diffused-base transistor which is a

228
0:13:56,420 --> 0:14:02,570
high-frequency high-speed device working

229
0:14:02,570 --> 0:14:04,400
together the development and

230
0:14:04,400 --> 0:14:06,260
manufacturing groups developed today's

231
0:14:06,260 --> 0:14:10,310
production methods now a single slice of

232
0:14:10,310 --> 0:14:12,980
silicon may contain as many as two

233
0:14:12,980 --> 0:14:30,680
thousand transistors

234
0:14:30,680 --> 0:14:33,660
the transistor is a truly remarkable

235
0:14:33,660 --> 0:14:36,480
device one of its features is its

236
0:14:36,480 --> 0:14:39,150
ability to perform at very low power

237
0:14:39,150 --> 0:14:46,590
levels as demonstrated here the light

238
0:14:46,590 --> 0:14:51,120
energy from a burning match falling on a

239
0:14:51,120 --> 0:14:55,260
solar battery is sufficient to drive

240
0:14:55,260 --> 0:15:00,720
this transistor oscillator

241
0:15:00,720 --> 0:15:02,639
a more important feature of the

242
0:15:02,639 --> 0:15:05,459
transistor is its reliability its

243
0:15:05,459 --> 0:15:07,980
ability to operate for extended periods

244
0:15:07,980 --> 0:15:10,709
of time without changing it can also

245
0:15:10,709 --> 0:15:12,959
transmit and amplify high-frequency

246
0:15:12,959 --> 0:15:16,680
signals at very high speed all these

247
0:15:16,680 --> 0:15:18,870
features contribute to modern switching

248
0:15:18,870 --> 0:15:30,089
in computer systems this tiny electronic

249
0:15:30,089 --> 0:15:32,699
device is the outcome of scientific

250
0:15:32,699 --> 0:15:36,089
research by trained men dedicated to

251
0:15:36,089 --> 0:15:39,329
understanding working in an environment

252
0:15:39,329 --> 0:15:41,819
which fosters the uninhibited search for

253
0:15:41,819 --> 0:15:44,639
answers to riddles of science which are

254
0:15:44,639 --> 0:15:49,290
related to communications needs for

255
0:15:49,290 --> 0:15:51,439
their discovery of the transistor effect

256
0:15:51,439 --> 0:15:55,829
John Bardeen Walter Brattain and William

257
0:15:55,829 --> 0:16:00,300
Shockley in 1956 shared the highest

258
0:16:00,300 --> 0:16:33,620
honor and science the Nobel Prize
