1
00:00:00,000 --> 0:00:03,570
a wide variety of modern systems depend

2
0:00:03,570 --> 0:00:05,190
for their operation on an invention

3
0:00:05,190 --> 0:00:07,859
devised at Bell Laboratories more than

4
0:00:07,859 --> 0:00:11,250
50 years ago it continues to be used

5
0:00:11,250 --> 0:00:13,530
throughout the Bell System and telephone

6
0:00:13,530 --> 0:00:16,320
sets the newest switching machines and

7
0:00:16,320 --> 0:00:18,420
modern systems for transmitting

8
0:00:18,420 --> 0:00:21,660
telephone calls this is an early version

9
0:00:21,660 --> 0:00:24,029
of that invention called a negative

10
0:00:24,029 --> 0:00:33,969
feedback amplifier

11
0:00:33,969 --> 0:00:36,070
in the early days of long-distance

12
0:00:36,070 --> 0:00:38,230
calling only a few voices could be

13
0:00:38,230 --> 0:00:41,110
carried on one pair of wires as long

14
0:00:41,110 --> 0:00
distance calling grew high-capacity

15
0:00 --> 0:00:45,100
systems were needed to carry many

16
0:00:45,100 --> 0:00:48,159
telephone calls simultaneously but

17
0:00:48,159 --> 0:00:50,559
signals used in high capacity systems

18
0:00:50,559 --> 0:00:53,199
need to be amplified more frequently and

19
0:00:53,199 --> 0:00:56,140
the available amplifiers distorted the

20
0:00:56,140 --> 0:01:00,670
signals in 1921 harold black began

21
0:01:00,670 --> 0:01:02,559
working on an efficient distortion-free

22
0:01:02,559 --> 0:01:04,629
amplifier that would permit

23
0:01:04,629 --> 0:01:06,610
long-distance transmission of large

24
0:01:06,610 --> 0:01:10,229
numbers of telephone calls at low cost I

25
0:01:10,229 --> 0:01:17,679
tried again and again to build practical

26
0:01:17,679 --> 0:01:21,759
or viable amplifiers that would

27
0:01:21,759 --> 0:01:26,039
accomplish what I was trying to do and

28
0:01:26,039 --> 0:01:31,409
each and every one was a total failure

29
0:01:31,409 --> 0:01:36,429
some even when I made a sketch I could

30
0:01:36,429 --> 0:01:40,590
see that I was getting nowhere

31
0:01:40,590 --> 0:01:47,340
and when I say nowhere I mean no way and

32
0:01:47,340 --> 0:01:51,720
then came the fateful morning in August

33
0:01:51,720 --> 0:01:57,819
of 1927 I boarded the ferry and went to

34
0:01:57,819 --> 0:02:04,820
work just like any other day

35
0:02:04,820 --> 0:02:07,270
I was looking at the Statue of Liberty

36
0:02:07,270 --> 0:02:12,800
and all of a sudden the idea came to me

37
0:02:12,800 --> 0:02:19,180
in the flesh I thought of how to make

38
0:02:19,180 --> 0:02:25,600
the negative feedback amplifier then I

39
0:02:25,600 --> 0:02:29,180
bought a New York time I had nothing

40
0:02:29,180 --> 0:02:33,440
right on so I bought it and I opened the

41
0:02:33,440 --> 0:02:38,060
pages and it was a mere accident that

42
0:02:38,060 --> 0:02:42,890
that particular day I had the name of

43
0:02:42,890 --> 0:02:45,830
the newspaper and the date and then the

44
0:02:45,830 --> 0:02:49,670
entire page was almost in a very clean

45
0:02:49,670 --> 0:02:57,260
tape and I by no means felt it I spent a

46
0:02:57,260 --> 0:03:01,910
little time making the diagram I called

47
0:03:01,910 --> 0:03:05,270
it a canonical diagram because it is

48
0:03:05,270 --> 0:03:08,770
universal and applies to anything

49
0:03:08,770 --> 0:03:13,660
electrical mechanical chemical

50
0:03:13,660 --> 0:03:17,420
hydrodynamic or any any any wave system

51
0:03:17,420 --> 0:03:21,430
that you can think of when I got to the

52
0:03:21,430 --> 0:03:24,980
laboratories and I ran to get there in

53
0:03:24,980 --> 0:03:25,489
the hurry

54
0:03:25,489 --> 0:03:33,360
I had that immediately

55
0:03:33,360 --> 0:03:39,300
witnessed and understood by EC bless one

56
0:03:39,300 --> 0:03:43,200
of my associate then I showed a copy of

57
0:03:43,200 --> 0:03:46,620
my diagram to st-

58
0:03:46,620 --> 0:03:53,880
and asked him to assemble the parts so

59
0:03:53,880 --> 0:03:58,680
that we could proceed with the making of

60
0:03:58,680 --> 0:04:05,870
a working model as the morning wore on

61
0:04:05,870 --> 0:04:12,180
he was doing well and many of them

62
0:04:12,180 --> 0:04:17,299
mounted but every 15 minutes I kept

63
0:04:17,299 --> 0:04:21,870
walking into the lavatory and saying

64
0:04:21,870 --> 0:04:25,610
Steve how are you doing and he said

65
0:04:25,610 --> 0:04:29,460
Harold I am doing fine but if you will

66
0:04:29,460 --> 0:04:32,400
just leave me alone go back in your

67
0:04:32,400 --> 0:04:36,320
office relax put your feet on the desk

68
0:04:36,320 --> 0:04:40,740
and maybe there will be other problems

69
0:04:40,740 --> 0:04:45,990
of the negative feedback amplifier that

70
0:04:45,990 --> 0:04:49,669
need to be attended to

71
0:04:49,669 --> 0:04:53,880
well that proved to be a better piece of

72
0:04:53,880 --> 0:04:58,100
advice and Steve intended I am sure

73
0:04:58,100 --> 0:05:04,820
because by the end of the we had a

74
0:05:04,820 --> 0:05:09,090
broadband negative feedback amplifier

75
0:05:09,090 --> 0:05:16,290
working which curiously enough had as

76
0:05:16,290 --> 0:05:22,160
much as 50 decibels of negative feedback

77
0:05:22,160 --> 0:05:28,190
more than enough to accomplish the job

78
0:05:28,190 --> 0:05:33,360
that I had started

79
0:05:33,360 --> 0:05:40,450
December 1921 the negative feedback

80
0:05:40,450 --> 0:05:44,020
amplifier works this way at the input is

81
0:05:44,020 --> 0:05:45,870
the low-level signal you want to amplify

82
0:05:45,870 --> 0:05:48,840
at the output is the amplified signal

83
0:05:48,840 --> 0:05:51,550
magnified in the way you want but the

84
0:05:51,550 --> 0:05:54,130
amplifier introduces distortion which is

85
0:05:54,130 --> 0:05:56,830
also magnified by connecting a small

86
0:05:56,830 --> 0:05:58,680
portion of the output back to the input

87
0:05:58,680 --> 0:06:01,690
the distortion is canceled and the

88
0:06:01,690 --> 0:06:04,750
signal becomes clear since the invention

89
0:06:04,750 --> 0:06:07,180
of negative feedback Harald black has

90
0:06:07,180 --> 0:06:09,310
received more than a dozen major awards

91
0:06:09,310 --> 0:06:11,260
and has been named a fellow of 10

92
0:06:11,260 --> 0:06:14,290
professional societies he still recalls

93
0:06:14,290 --> 0:06:16,270
the day when it all began with a flash

94
0:06:16,270 --> 0:06:18,900
of recognition more than 50 years ago

95
0:06:18,900 --> 0:06:23,560
the flash of recognition is something

96
0:06:23,560 --> 0:06:29,350
that I was unable to understand at the

97
0:06:29,350 --> 0:06:34,360
time and in the 50 years that have gone

98
0:06:34,360 --> 0:06:37,660
by and I have thought of it again and

99
0:06:37,660 --> 0:07:01,110
again I have no explanation whatsoever

100
0:07:01,110 --> 0:07:03,170
you
